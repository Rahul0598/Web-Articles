WASHINGTON, DEC. 31. Condemning the hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane, the Democratic Congressman from New Jersey, Mr. Frank Pallone, has spoken of the need for increased India, U.S. partnership in identifying shared threats and in protecting their people. He also said that Pakistan must be held accountable for the ongoing violence and instability.
``The incident is another reminder of the threat that terrorism poses to all democracies. India and the United States have both been particularly targeted by Osama bin Laden and the loose network of militant forces that share his goals. This is a further indication of the need for increased partnership between the U.S. and India in identifying the shared threats we face and devising ways to protect our citizens in ways consistent with open, democratic societies,'' Mr. Pallone said.
Mr. Pallone said the hostage situation was linked to the militant movement in Kashmir.
``I hope this incident will alert the world to the threat India faces from this terrorist movement. I believe that Pakistan must be held accountable for contributing to this violence and instability. There should be more pressure brought to bear on Pakistan to be part of the solution, instead of continuing to exacerbate this problem,'' Mr.Pallone said.
