NEW DELHI, JAN. 3. The Union Home Ministry has refused to ban Mr. Khushwant Singh's novel The Company of Women, saying interference with the freedom of expression and reading should be in the rarest of the rare cases.
In his last week's order, the Home Secretary, Mr. Kamal Pande, observed that no conscious attempt was being made to circulate and distribute copies of the book among those who are at an impressionable age with a view to unduly influence them with what was written and described in the book.
While rejecting a representation made by Mr. K.S. Radhakrishnan, an advocate, the Home Secretary observed that in matters of selection and choice for reading it would be prudent to leave it to the good sense of the reader to take a decision on whether a book should be read or not.
The Home Secretary noted that notwithstanding how a section of the public is disposed towards Mr. Khushwant Singh, he remains a respected author and editor.
``His proclivity for pungent and sex-oriented writing is well- known though in certain quarters it is accepted with amusement and in others it is frowned and adversely commented upon.''
