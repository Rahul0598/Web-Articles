KANCHEEPURAM. JAN 4. The former Union minister and Thamizhaga Rajiv Congress president, Mr Vazhapadi K Ramamurthy, has said that his party would abide by the decision of the Chief Minister, Mr. M Karunanidhi, with regard to elections to the two Rajya Sabha seats from Tamil Nadu.
Talking to mediapersons at the Kanchi mutt here today, Mr. Ramamurthy said that he would convey his party's opinion to the Chief Minister soon. When asked whether he would contest for a Rajya Sabha seat, he said that he would talk about it to the Chief Minister. We will accept any decision he takes, he added.
When his attention was drawn to an opinion that the
Tamil Maanila Congress, the AIADMK and the Congress (I) were coming closer on certain issues, the former minister noted that `the TMC Chief, Mr. G K Moopanar, participates in an Ifthaar party along with the AIADMK general secretary, Ms. Jayalalitha. Later, he shares platform with the Chief Minister at a function to felicitate cine actor Rajnikanth and finally presents a book titled `You can win' to Mr. Karunanidhi at Kanyakumari'.
Mr. Ramamurthy said that the TMC leader was making contradictory statements with regard to the alliance between the DMK and TMC in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. All these only proved that Mr. Moopanar was afflicted with `disillusionment in politics.'
He came down heavily on those who were criticising the State Government's initiative to set up farmers' markets. The former Union minister said that though there were many schemes to help the farmers, the farmers' market benefitted them directly. By eliminating the middlemen, it helped both the producers and the consumers, he said.
He commented that Ms Jayalalitha was behaving like a `non- resident Tamilian.' She was staying away from the State under the false impression that the people of Tamil Nadu would continue to vote for her irrespective of whatever she did.
