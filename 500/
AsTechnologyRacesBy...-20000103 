According to Prof. R. Natarajan, Director, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, the third millennium, will be quite different from the first and the second in many ways. There is so much more information and knowledge, not only generated, but also available and accessible at the touch of a key; there are so many more people competing for the rapidly dwindling natural resources (energy, materials, water...) of the planet; there is a host of environmental problems (global warming, ozone depletion; air and water pollution; solid waste disposal...) to be tackled; 'jobless growth' worldwide; escalating aspirations fuelled by technological advances and media hype; widening gap and disparities between different strata of society; erosion of values; and so on. "Technology and Technical Education will have a substantial role to play in shaping the future of our life, livelihood and leisure. The role of Technology in enhancing the creation and delivery of Education is just beginning to be exploited, while the role of life-long learning to provide just- in-time education has been well-recognised. Machines or computers will not replace teachers, but the role of the teacher will undergo a transformation from that of a knowledge-provider to that of a mentor. The student population is also undergoing a transformation - it is more informed, less tolerant of boredom, and demands instant knowledge.
"All in all, we march forward with a host of challenges and opportunities confronting use. Let us march forward with wisdom and preparedness", he adds.
Prof. A. Kalanidhi, Vice-Chancellor, Anna University, wishes that youngsters, with the amazing Information Technology to aid them would help make our country a super power. And insofar as Anna University is concerned, it will offer services in human resource training and render the much needed support for growth in R and D, in various areas of work. "It is his earnest hope that in the new millennium Anna University emerges as the largest technical university in the country to offer solutions to problems all over the world. Professionals around the country will get a chance to upgrade their qualifications. "A commendable service from our University is on the cards," the VC concludes.
