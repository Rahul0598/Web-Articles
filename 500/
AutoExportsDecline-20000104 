NEW DELHI, JAN 3. While the automobile sector sold a record number of cars in the domestic market in the first eight months of the current fiscal, figures released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIMA) show that the performance on the export front was tardy. The only exception was the commercial vehicle category where Telco's strong performance helped exports increase by about 30 per cent.
In the much publicised and aggressively marketed passenger cars segment where each claims to have brought world class cars to India, none of the manufacturers showed a growth in exports. It was left to Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL) to prop up the exports figures as six out of the dozen companies operating in the country failed to export a single car in the first eight months.
In the passenger car sector, total exports between April and November this fiscal stood at 12,375 as against 14,270 during the same period last year. The figure was a far cry from the 17,374 cars exported between April-November 1997. Maruti with 11,481 cars accounted for the bulk of the exports, followed by Daewoo at 380. Mercedes Benz exported 292 units as compared to 465 during the first eight months of the last fiscal and Telco could sell just 61 units in overseas markets as compared to 973 last year. Honda and IndAuto made a debut in the export market this year by shipping 14 and 147 cars, respectively. According to the SIAM, no cars were exported during the first eight months of the current fiscal by Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Hindustan Motors, Hyundai and the nearly defunct PAL-Peugeot.
Daewoo officials said today that their export performance would have been better but for the delay in shipping 500 cars to Italy. ``There has been a delay on account of sudden upsurge in domestic demand,'' said the company's Deputy Managing Director, Mr. B. S. Min.
