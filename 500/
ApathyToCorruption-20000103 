Sir, - A sessions judge (Mr. J. W. Singh) is involved in charges of corruption and extortion and an arrest warrant has been issued against him. A senior Indian Revenue Service Officer (Mr. Ashok Agarwal) who dealt with sensitive cases against political heavyweights (the former Union Ministers, Mr. Sukh Ram, Mr. Krishna Kumar, etc,) is arrested by the CBI for fabricating evidence and for forgery. Such reports no longer evoke outrage in the public mind. For, India has the dubious distinction of being the third most corrupt country.
Prof. Amartya Sen has remarked that a worldwide movement for democracy holds the key to development. A widespread movement for combating corruption is necessary to reap the fruits of democracy. The World Bank President, Mr. James D. Wolfensohn, suggested that anti-corruption measures be integrated into economic reforms. Advocates of laissez-faire declare that centrally-administered economies breed corruption. But free market economies and globalisation cannot be said to be free from the canker. Corruption seems to make no distinction between the developed and developing nations.
The Mundhra affair rocked the nation in 1957. It was a flea-bite compared to the securities scam which hit the headlines in 1992. A succession of scams and scandals followed, but they have ceased to cause even a ripple.
Mega deals of the Government are shrouded in secrecy, thanks to the Official Secrets Act of colonial vintage. Criticism of legislators provokes a privilege motion or action for contempt of the House. Criticism of judges is taken as contempt of court, and truth is no defence. The promised Freedom of Information Act is nowhere in sight. The Lok Pal Bill is still a distant dream. Neither a judicial probe, an inquiry by a parliamentary committee nor investigation by the CBI has so far achieved concrete results.
