THE orange orb of the sun sank into the horizon. It was cacophony as usual at the Adyar-Taramani junction. Buses and cars zoomed past in a cloud of dust and smoke. Cutting across the motorised danger, as one entered the idyllic environs of the MGR Film City, vehicles screeched to a halt at the VVIP entrance. And out tip- toed the movers and shakers of showville and politics in Tamil Nadu. Through another entrance, humanity snaked its way to the open-air auditorium, the venue of "Rajni 25".
Inside, the air crackled with energy. Some bedecked stars scanned the rows for known faces, while some others hunted for vacant seats.
The "super duper show," as Latha Rajnikanth called it was about to begin. Kill-time "Rajni 25 Oh Oh..." played in the background. Superstar Rajni had turned 25, in tinseldom that is. And the evening's programme was actually one woman's salutation to her achiever husband, in public that is. And naturally, the "thalaivars", "thondars" and "rasigars" had come to join her to appreciate their "Dalapathi".
For Shivaji Rao Gaekwad, one of Tamil Nadu's most enduring myths, it was a golden moment in his life. He did not hide his grey even for such a self-centric mega event. For along with age has come an abundance of self-worth, power and fame. From a bus conductor to someone who could call the shots in Tamil Nadu politics from his living room, Rajni has seen it all. Populist roles have made him the numero uno, if not the best actor. It is not difficult to understand success in his case. For he had plenty of what his numerous fans would call "ishtyle". And he made no bones about making an overt expression of it - in his walk, talk, dance and stunt.
And it was this distinct style of Rajni that came to the fore at the event. But only, there was too much of it. It was over three hours of Rajni, Latha, Rajni, Latha and more Rajni and more Latha. Overkill, to be precise. That a man could sit and watch artistes and his wife sing his praise for hours on end (for public consumption!) was too much for the grey cells. Never mind the fact that it was for a cause.
The line-up of performers, barring a few such as Prabhu Deva, Kanal Kannan, Kalyan, Ramya Krishnan, Meena and Devayani were far from impressive. After Madhuvanti Arun's Pushpanjali there were a host of song, dance and stunt shows that offered a kaleidoscopic view of Rajni's films.
The star attractions were Prabhu Deva and of course, the spectacular laser beams that danced their way into the audience's hearts. In his fluid ensemble replete with sudden leg thrusts, knee flexions, pelvic lunges, march-like swaggering and gliding torso movements, Prabhu Deva brought alive the irrepressible vitality of dance. The propulsive, hugely amplified beats and barrages of psychedelic lights further fuelled his appeal.
In between came the most important part of the show - the talk show - of politicians and film personalities. What stood out amidst the staple speeches by the Chief Minister Mr. M. Karunanidhi, TMC chief G. K. Moopanar, K. Balachander, Shatrughan Sinha, Ambarish and Mohan Babu was that of Rajni's. In his vivid style the superstar said that his was not a "saekra kootam" (assembled crowd) but a "thaana saerugira kootam" (crowd that comes on its own) and that he knew how to "vasool" (collect) and also pay back. He called upon his esctactic fans to meditate regularly and urged the government to end video piracy, which if let to flourish would lead to actors (what about the rest of filmdom?) giving stage shows.
And the show went on... No matter the menacing mosquitoes and cough-provoking cold, the fans stayed on... till it ended with the new singing sensation Latha Rajnikanth's "Bharatam". The accompaniments were however the splendid fireworks. A fiery touch indeed to a well-coordinated though lacklustre show.
