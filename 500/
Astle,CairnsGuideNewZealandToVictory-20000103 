AUCKLAND, JAN. 2. New Zealand won the first one-day international fo the five-match series against the West Indies by three wickets here on Sunday, by reaching a rain-reduced target of 250 in the final over.
Batting first, the West Indies scored 268 for seven off its 50 overs but a 20-minute rain delay after the 31st over reduced New Zealand's victory target. Instead of 269, the home side was asked to score 250 off 46 overs.
New Zealand owed its victory to man of the match Nathan Astle (77) and Chris Cairns (75) after some solid West Indies batting from skipper Brian Lara (76), Ridley Jacobs (65) and Sherwin Campbell (51).
The West Indies got off to a flyer, with an entertaining opening stand of 111 from Jacobs and Campbell. After 15 overs they had knocked up 96. The innings was becalmed from the 16th to 30th overs after Jacobs and Campbell were dismissed. It picked up when Lara and and Ricardo Powell were together for a fourth wicket stand of 91. Powell's departure after a bright 35 prompted a flurry of West Indies wickets. Lara, dropped when 59, hit his 76 off just 81 balls with three fours and two sixes.
New Zealand's best bowling came from left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, who gave away only 28 runs and took one wicket in his full complement of 10 overs.
New Zealand started sedately, but exploded in the sixth over when Astle and craig Spearman helped themselves to 15 runs off Franklyn Rose's third over. But in the next over Spearman got an edge and was caught brilliantly behind the stumps for 25 with the score 44 for one.
Reon King bowled superbly to keep New Zealand's early batting in check and score after 15 overs when fielding restrictions ended was 71 for three, compared with the West Indies' 96 without loss at the same stage.
But Cairns joined Astle and they resurrected the New Zealand innings with a partnership of 136. Cairns' 75 contained with two fours and six sixes.
