BANGALORE, JAN. 1. All ISRO satellites passed through the millennium transition and no anomalies were reported.
The transition occurred at 5.30 a.m. IST today. Space systems operations follow GMT as reference time which is five-and-a-half hours behind IST.
The ISRO has five INSAT satellites, INSAT ID, 2B, 2C, 2DT and 2E, five remote sensing satellites, IRS 1B, 1C, IRS 1D, P3 and P4, besides the scientific satellite SROSS C2 in operation.
The ISRO initiated Y2K compliance activities way back in June 1998.
The INSAT and IRS systems had been assessed to be Y2K indifferent as they operated by referencing the Sun and did not contemplate time and dates.
So they were not expected to face any problem.
