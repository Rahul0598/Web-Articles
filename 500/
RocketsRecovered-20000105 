JAMMU, JAN. 4. Nine Chinese-made 107-mm sophisticated rockets have been recovered from near the Mam stadium in Jammu city, where the State-level Republic Day function is held every year. The solar energy-activated rockets, with capacity to damage big buildings within a range of seven to 10 km, were believed to have been planted by a Pakistan-backed militant, Irfan, who had escaped from Kotbaliwal jail here last October.
