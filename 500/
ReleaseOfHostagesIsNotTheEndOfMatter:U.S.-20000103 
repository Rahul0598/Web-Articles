WASHINGTON, JAN. 2. The Clinton administration has not said much officially on the whereabouts of the hijackers of the Indian Airlines flight 814; but is expected to be following the situation very carefully. For the record the administration has made it plain that while it is relieved that the sordid drama in Kandahar had ended without further loss of life, the larger story was far from over.
``The release of the hostages is not the end of the matter. We will work with other Governments to see that those responsible are brought to justice,'' said the State Department. And the focus will be for the most part in Pakistan where it is generally believed that the hijackers had slipped into from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Islamabad's contention that it is on high alert for the hijackers and the three freed terrorists, and will put them on trial if arrested will be put to test in the next several days. One view is that their whereabouts will be known in the next several days. ``They cannot vanish'' has been one refrain.
Right from the moment the final ``deal'' was being put together, it was clear that the hijackers' destination was going to be Pakistan only. The Taliban Representative at the United Nations, Mr. Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, had said in a conversation with The Hindu that the hijackers and the three freed terrorists would ``never'' be allowed to stay behind in Afghanistan. The fate of the hijackers and their freed ``friends'' was apparently one of the most difficult issues that had to be sorted out in the final phases.
If the Taliban Representative was repeatedly firm and adamant that the hijackers and the freed terrorists had ``to get out'' of Afghanistan, some of this had to do with media reports circulating that somehow the hijackers and the freed terrorists would be staying back in Afghanistan to face the local law. The Taliban also wanted to put down any speculation that it was about to grant asylum to those who in their view had committed a very un-Islamic act.
Politically there is no doubt that the Taliban expects ``something'' in return from India for the role it played in the hijacking crisis. In fact, he said it was only moral and the Islamic duty of the Taliban to extend the hand of cooperation during the crisis period. At the same time he argued that the vision for the future of Taliban-India relations was in the hands of New Delhi. ``The Taliban wants friendly relations with every country; and in the past Afghanistan has had good relations with India,'' he said.
Officially too there will be keen interest on how the Clinton administration will go about in dealing with the Taliban. But if the last three days are anything to go by there is hardly anything to indicate of any change in stance vis-a-vis Washington.
And it is expected to remain this way. Although the administration has an official channel open with the Taliban, there is actually no love lost for this outfit, especially when it relates to Osama bin Laden and the persistent demand that he should be handed over to the U.S. authorities.
