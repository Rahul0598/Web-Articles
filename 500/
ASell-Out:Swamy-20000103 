TIRUNELVELI, JAN. 2. The Janata Party came down heavily on the BJP-led NDA Government at the Centre for releasing three hardcore terrorists in exchange for over 150 hostages of the hijacked IA plane and said it was a ``sell-out of national interests and abject surrender before the fundamentalists.''
A resolution to this effect was adopted at the executive committee meeting of the party's State unit here today.
The party said that not three but eight terrorists had been released. This was not the first time that the ``Hindutva forces had betrayed the nation's interest.''
The resolution said the Centre was duty-bound to explain to the people why the Prime Minister had failed to consider alternative options and was from the beginning insistent on releasing the terrorists. Also, why was it necessary for the External Affairs Minister to accompany the released militants to Kandhahar? Mr. Jaswant Singh carried $15 million and gold drawn from the RAW's secret fund as payment to the hijackers, it alleged. The party's district units will hold demonstrations in front of the Collectorates shortly to condemn the ``sellout'' and demanded Mr. Vajpayee's resignation. The Government should also not show any favour to the Rajiv assassins.
