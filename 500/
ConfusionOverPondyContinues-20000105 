NEW DELHI, JAN. 4. Suspense continues over the political situation in Pondicherry, where the Tamil Maanila Congress withdrew from the coalition Government last week but is still supporting the DMK.
There were conflicting reports today on Mr. G. K. Moopanar, TMC chief, meeting the Congress(I) president, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi. Reliable sources in 10, Janpath said that Mr. Moopanar had called on Mrs. Gandhi this evening and had a 15- minute discussion with her on the situation in Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu. He had also met her on Monday.
However, Mr. Moopanar denied having met Mrs. Gandhi today. He reiterated his stand that he ``would not be the cause of the fall of the Government''. He left Delhi tonight.
Sources in the Congress(I) said the party leadership felt that it was up to the TMC to decide whether to continue supporting the DMK or not. It was only after this that the Congress(I) would have any role to play. The party does not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.
