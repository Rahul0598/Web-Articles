NEW DELHI, JAN. 3. When the hijackers of the Indian Airlines plane asked the lone American among the hostages to spell `coffin' she expected the worst.
``When the bad guys approached me and asked `what do you call the box to keep a body', I thought it was meant for me,'' Ms. Jeanne Moore of Bakersfield, California, who is trying to shake off the trauma of the eight-day ordeal said before leaving for home today.
``I spelt the word coffin and wrote it on a piece of paper and gave it to them, not knowing what was going to happen,'' said Ms. Moore, a teacher and psychotherapist.
The hijackers had demanded that the body of Harkat-ul- Ansar chief, Sajjad Afghani, be exhumed and the coffin handed over to them.
Having on her mind the abduction of foreign tourists, including two Americans in Kashmir in 1995 by Kashmiri militants, Ms. Moore often came to terms with the possibility of dying during the standoff.
``I always felt the pressure of being an American ... And was always expecting the worse to happen to me and I comforted myself by thinking about my family and my friends,'' she said.
``They took my passport, and my offer to speak with my government was turned down making me more worried,'' she recalled. Even after being released, Ms. Moore was relieved only after her son, a police officer, flew down here to meet her.
She described how the hijackers played on the nerves of their captives. ``Every day it was a new adventure. Several times I thought of dealing with the hijackers... But I knew it was not a good plan. I knew the ramifications''.
``The hijackers kept saying `we love you, we don't want to hurt you'... But we knew that wasn't true,'' since they stabbed one man and slit his throat when he refused to remain blindfolded. ``That was the terror tactics of the day''.
``Though they were nice to women and children, I got hit on my head by one of the hijackers when I tried to bend and blow off a bug on my hand,'' said the American, who spent Christmas day in the plane.
``It is truly amazing that anyone can be so cruel. The hijackers cracked jokes in local lingo but I was least interested and, like most other passengers, I tried to catch some sleep,'' she said.
``At one point of time they used to terrorise us and then you see them handing over packets of food. We were confused,'' Ms. Moore, who was sick when she emplaned from Kathmandu, said.
When the negotiations were stalled and the hijackers began threatening to kill hostages, ``I expected a commando operation any time and bullets being sprayed and me in the middle... Phew! its over,'' she heaved a sigh of relief.
``The scene in there was not just like out of a Hollywood thriller which is dramatic and exciting...It was terror and bad stuff. They (hijackers) smelt bad''. ``Thank God, I'm back in this world,'' she said.
