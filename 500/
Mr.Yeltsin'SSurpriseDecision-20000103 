EVEN JUDGING BY his own rather unconventional ways and unorthodox methods, Mr. Boris Yeltsin's surprise action in announcing his resignation as Russia's President should be difficult to read. Not particularly known for timing his often controversial actions, he has lived up to his well-earned reputation as an unpredictable leader. His latest action is even more incomprehensible since he was least expected to leave the Presidency when the political milieu had become distinctly friendlier to him, whatever the state of his health. For the first time since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the President has a legislature that is not openly hostile to him. Mr. Yeltsin's supporters and sympathisers had scored a spectacular and unexpected victory in parliamentary elections in mid-December, presenting him with the prospect of a harmonious relationship between the legislature and the executive. For nearly a decade he had been forced to contend with a communist- dominated Duma, the Lower House of Parliament which blocked every legislative move of his administration. Cohabiting with the Duma had become a highly frustrating experience and Mr. Yeltsin was more than once forced to threaten to dissolve the House if it did not approve his action. Till he picked the last one, Mr. Yeltsin even found it difficult to get parliamentary confirmation for his Prime Ministerial candidate. After the latest elections to the Duma, the communists will continue to be the largest single party but they are short of the stalling power they wielded for the past six years.
What then prompted the 68-year-old Mr. Yeltsin to take such a momentous decision? Certainly not failing health since he has ignored earlier alarms and shown remarkable ability to bounce back to centre stage even after more serious ailments. Only a fortnight ago, immediately after a renewed bout of pneumonia forced him into hospital, he insisted on keeping his scheduled visit to Beijing and seemed none the worse for the journey. From the Chinese capital, he rattled his nuclear arsenal, only to be reminded politely by his American counterpart that he owed his position in Moscow not a little to the support given by the Western nations at a critical time of transition for his country. The most plausible explanation for his resignation is that after being satisfied that he has found a suitable heavyweight successor in the current Prime Minister, Mr. Vladimir Putin, he feels he can quit especially when the going is good. The Presidential election, due in six months, has now been advanced by three months and Mr. Yeltsin has anointed Mr. Putin, a Soviet secret service top brass, as his nominee.
Mr. Yeltsin, himself a top Soviet communist party official, came into prominence when, in a classic act of defiance, he led the resistance against coup plotters who tried to overthrow the last Soviet President, Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev. His rise to the Presidency, showdown with the Duma when he ordered tanks to open fire on the Parliament building to flush out Opposition members holed up inside, the manner in which he sacked his whole Cabinet overnight without offering any explanation (his opponents call it a brain bypass), other bizarre actions, some of them certainly impulsive and inexplicable, and the strong, even desperate measures he has undertaken to defeat armed militancy in Chechnya will ensure that he leaves a mixed legacy. But as the December 19 parliamentary election testified, he has safeguarded, however imperfectly, the historic transition to democracy from the authoritarian eight-decade-long Soviet era. This is no mean achievement.
