NEW DELHI, JAN. 1. The Government did not have any option but to release the hardcore militants to secure the safe return of hostages from the hijacked aircraft, security experts said today.
However, one of them said there had been ``a big series of errors'' which resulted in the narrowing down of options and release of the three militants would encourage others to take recourse to similar actions in future.
Mr. Jasjit Singh, Director, Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA), said the aircraft was in a ``sanctuary with Pakistan in between''. This had left the Government with no option but to enter into ``some form of give and take''.
Saying the release would not have any impact on militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Singh said it was wrong to compare the current situation with that during which some militants were released to get Ms. Rubaiya Sayeed back.
``The situation then was that insurgency and proxy war had just started, whereas now there are only suicidal attacks which basically is transnational terrorism,'' he said.
Lt. Gen. (Retd.) V. R. Raghavan, former Director General Military Operations (DGMO), however, castigated the Government for ``handling the hijacking negotiations very incompetently'' and claimed that ``a big series of errors'' were committed which had reduced the number of options.
Asserting that the release of militants would encourage others to take recourse to similar actions, he said the aircraft should have been stopped at the Amritsar airport even if that would have meant killing of a few more passengers.
Gen. (Retd.) K. Nambiar, who commanded the IPKF operations against LTTE in Sri Lanka, said under the circumstances in which Pakistan and the Taliban had ``the upper hand throughout'', there was no other option but to release the terrorists.Noted defence analyst, Mr. K. Subrahmanyam, who headed the comprehensive probe team on Kargil intrusion and the conflict, said the hijacking was a ``victory for terrorism'' and ``no amount of verbiage or dissimulation can convert this setback into a victory for India''.
