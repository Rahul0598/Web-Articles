Reports from New York, noted with regret on January 3, that the Kashmir negotiations had come to an absolute standstill and both the concerned delegations found themselves in the midst of masterly inactivity. Faced with the prospect of ennui, Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai was even contemplating returning to India. Gen. McNaughton, who had been playing the role of mediator, had been a member of the Council, and had won for himself a good name and could even claim credit for helping to break the deadlock over Indonesia.
India, in the amendments she had proposed to his plan, had stuck to her guns and had not budged a single inch from the positions she had all along taken and any further mediation Gen. McNaughton might make on the basis of the published plan was bound to result in failure.
Nobody seemed to have any suggestion to make which would really resolve the deadlock. On the other hand, there seemed to be some inexplicable desire among some members of the Security Council to please Pakistan.
As long as that frame of mind existed it was difficult to see how anything constructive could come out of the present phase of negotiations. Observers hoped that the Council would not rush to adopt a resolution based on the McNaughton plan because India, rightly, was bound to reject it. So, it was also felt that the Council might well adopt a policy of drift as was done in the case of Palestine, allow the deadlock to continue, seeing to it, of course, that there was no loss of ground already gained and no renewal of shooting in Kashmir.
