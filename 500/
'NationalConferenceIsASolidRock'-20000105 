Dr. S. M. Kamaal, Minister (I&C), Jammu and Kashmir, writes:
This has reference to the news item which has appeared on December. 28. issue of your esteemed paper under the caption,``Fissures in National Conference.'' I was startled to go through it as I found it to be with no foundation whatsoever. It is just a figment of imagination of the age old enemies of National Conference.
Let me put the record straight and lay it down for all our political opponents and for the posterity that Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Chief Minister of the State is not only my elder brother but also my leader after Sher-i-Kashmir. I never had any differences with him nor have I any now. It is his prerogative to allocate whatsoever portfolio to whomsoever he wants. I have been happy with earlier portfolios and am happy right now. Let it be also reiterated that I am proud of my nephew, Omar Abdullah, who has made it a second time to the Lok Sabha with public mandate and that he is doing extremely well in the Union Council of Ministers. I wish him well and both of us will put in all the best to help the needy people. This is the goal set forth for us by the illustrious Sher-i-Kashmir. He had warned us and all the people that sustained efforts will be made by our detractors in destabilising the fortress of National Conference. Let me tell them we are on guard.
The command of National Conference is in the hands of a lovable and dynamic leader, Dr. Farooq Abdullah. I will stand by him through thick and thin along will all workers of the party.
The party general secretary, Sheikh Nazir Ahmed, is not only a dynamic general secretary of the J&K National Conference but a proper person to man this very important post for which he has had the good fortune to work under Sher-i-Kashmir. I have the highest regards for him and his tireless work for the party.
That should set at rest all the speculations of the vested interests.
