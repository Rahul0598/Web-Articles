Sir, - As you have rightly pointed out in the Editorial (Jan. 1), the Government has paid a heavy price for getting the hostages aboard the hijacked Indian Airlines plane released. The freeing of three hardcore terrorists will give a boost to terrorist activities in Kashmir, and elsewhere across the border.
The Government has succumbed to threats despite the Prime Minister's earlier stance that it would not be cowed down - all because of its inept handling of the crisis right from the time the aircraft first landed at Amritsar. Mistake after mistake compounded it. Internationally, our prestige has suffered. The hijackers and the Taliban have succeeded in internationalising the Kashmir problem. We had to take the help of a U.N. representative to resolve this crisis ab initio.
The Government must keep a close watch on the movements of the freed hijackers and terrorists, and see that they are captured and brought to book. Also, the true colour of the Taliban must not be lost sight of - let us beware its motives.
