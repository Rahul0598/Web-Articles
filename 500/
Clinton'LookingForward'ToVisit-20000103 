WASHINGTON, JAN. 2. The U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, has said he is looking forward to visiting India. ``We are going to make it this time,'' he remarked in the course of a brief conversation with the Congress(I) leader from Mumbai, Mr. Murli Deora. Mr. Deora was among those invited to the White House for the millennium celebrations that included a dinner.
Mr. Deora told The Hindu that he told Mr. Clinton, that if democracy had to survive, the U.S. had to support ``true and vibrant'' democracies. On the economic front, with the passage of the Insurance Bill, India was opening up in other sectors of the economy as well. Mr. Clinton apparently made the point that the gains or benefits of economic liberalisation must be spread.
Mr. Deora was also introduced to the Secretary of State, Ms. Madeleine Albright, who said she was ``glad the hostage crisis is over''. Saying she was looking forward to visiting India, Ms. Albright told Mr. Deora, ``I have a family history of knowing India and the Kashmir issue.''
