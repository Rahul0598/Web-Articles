Sir, - Thanks to your thoughtful Editorial (TheHindu, Jan. 1). You have lucidly analysed how the hijackers of the Indian Airlines plane planned ``their chilling strategy down to the last detail''. The planning must been done with the connivance of many for many months.
Why could the Indian Government not persuade authorities in Dubai to stall the departure of the hijacked aircraft for Kandahar?
The citizens of India must also be told why there was so much delay in finalising the cases against the Harkat-ul-Mujahadeen cleric, Maulana Masood Azhar, and other arrested militants. That is the main reason for the militants and other fundamentalists indulging in nefarious activities.
Now, how are we going to annihilate cross-border terrorism (in Kashmir)? Why is the United Nations silent, not dealing adequately with the fundamentalist regime in Afghanistan? Why have the Government of India's strategy and tactics in the hijack episode ``foundered''? Does it mean we have to restructure our defence and foreign policies? Can we continue to pin our faith on the Taliban's professions?
Will the United States redouble its efforts at thwarting Pakistan's attempts to encourage fundamentalist groups? Will the sole superpower, with the assistance of leading nations, take quick action to destroy the Afghan fundamentalist militia? The time has come for India to relentlessly pursue national interest with single-mindedness and finesse, and to change the basic structure of its foreign policy.
