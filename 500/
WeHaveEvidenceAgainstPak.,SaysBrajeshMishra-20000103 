NEW DELHI, JAN. 2. The National Security Adviser, Mr. Brajesh Mishra, today said there was ``enough and clear'' evidence to suggest that Pakistan was involved in the hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane and ruled out the possibility of Taliban having provided arms to the hijackers in Kandahar.
The behaviour of Pakistan from the first day when it said that India had stage-managed the hijacking and that an Indian intelligence agent with a particular seat number was travelling in the aircraft showed Pakistan's intentions, he said while participating in a programme on Star News.
``We have the names of all the hijackers who are Pakistani nationals, and most of the militants they wanted to be released are Pakistani nationals,'' he said.
Asked if there was any direct linkage between Pakistan and the hijacking, he said: ``Pakistani establishment is definitely responsible for it. All evidence and intercepts suggest this. One such intercept showed that a militant outfit in Jammu and Kashmir asked another in the State why it condemned the hijacking. The other replied that we got instructions from Pakistan.''
