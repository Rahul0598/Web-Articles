CHENNAI, JAN. 3. The Tamil Nadu Government today announced bonus for various categories of its employees for Pongal.
While the C and D staff will get a bonus equivalent to 29 days of pay, a special bonus of Rs. 825 will be given to the A and B staff and a gift of Rs. 150 to pensioners and family pensioners.
The bonus for the C and D will be calculated on the basis of a maximum monthly salary of Rs. 2,500. Employees working in local bodies and teachers and non-teaching staff of government-aided educational institutions are eligible to get the bonus.
Part-time and full-time contingency employees, staff who are getting consolidated pay and honorarium, noon meal scheme staff working on special pay scale and those who have worked for more than 240 days in a year on daily basis are also eligible for the special bonus.
About 12.50 lakh employees and 3.75 lakh pensioners and family pensioners will be benefitted by the government order, which will cost the exchequer about Rs. 238 crores. ``Like last year, the Government decided to give bonus and special bonus for the current year despite financial burden,'' said an official press release.
The Government has also issued orders for immediate disbursement of funds to all the village panchayats in the State through the respective District Collectors for setting up libraries/reading rooms in memory of the Saint-Poet Thiruvalluvar on the occasion of the `Thiruvalluvar Day' on January 16, 2000.
This is to give effect to an announcement the Chief Minister, Mr. M. Karunanidhi, made at Kanyakumari on January 1, after unveiling the 133-ft. statue of Thiruvalluvar.
In setting up these resource centres, to be officially called `Aiyan Thiruvalluvar Noolagam, Padipagam', the Government has advised the village panchayats to make use of existing library buildings. Where such facilities do not exist, the village panchayats have been asked to go in for temporary structures.
