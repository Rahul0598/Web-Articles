THE SENSE of wonder over the British who came to India with the East India Company as traders eventually taking over the entire country to rule over it for nearly two centuries still persists among many. In his Discovery of India, Nehru wrote that the wrong England of Robert Clive came to the wrong India of decaying emperors.
After the crumbling of the Moghul and the Maratha empires, the country was dropping like a plum to be picked up by the British. It was quite possible that like the Moghuls who came from Central Asia as invaders and settled down in the country, the incoming British might have also done the same thing to enrich India's ethnic texture. This did happen to some extent as a result of the marital mixing of the incoming Englishmen with the native Indian girls (cases of English girls marrying Indian males had been very rare) to bring into being an Anglo-India.
This ethnic enriching might well have gone on unchecked had not history begun to assert itself with England becoming much closer to India with its ocean-faring steamships and the telegraph. The East India Company, having settled down as a trading company could legitimise its looting of the country's raw materials by shipping them at rock bottom prices to the factories rapidly coming up in England after the Industrial Revolution to give itself a captive market for the products of its industries. The earliest instance of the English having gained such a market in this country mentioned in the book under notice is the import of steam engines into Lucknow from the Birmingham factory of Matthew Boulton and James Watt before 1800 A.D.
Among the ``ifs'' of history is that had it not been for the routing of India's raw materials to England by the East India Company, the Industrial Revolution in England and Europe would have quickly reached this country which would have taken its place among the indutrialised nations two centuries earlier, instead of having sunk to backwardness and poverty under British rule.
It must be admitted that the enslaving and impoverishing of India could not have been so thoroughly achieved by the East India Company without the help it was getting from Indians themselves with the scoundrels from England joining hands with the scoundrels in India. This should explain the aptness of the title of this book Engaging Scoundrels though the author might not have seen the happenings in India at the time she is writing about in this manner.
The book takes a long look at the Nawabs of Ayodhya ruling from Lucknow - the English called it Oudh - and the Englishmen who came to them initially as suppliants before a British resident took virtual control of Lucknow and the kingdom.
The utter heartlessness of the English is vividly described right at the beginning of the book with scenes of an English hunting party charging with their cavalry right across richly cultivated land waiting to be harvested ``often followed by poor cultivators running behind the Vizier's elephant bawling out for mercy.'' This should, however, recall a scene of a similar description of a chase after wild boars in feudal England itself across fields of ripening corn. With the recent ``bash'' at the wedding of Mr. Laloo Prasad Yadav's daughter getting much media attention, a description of a similar wedding given in the book inclines the reader to think that this was part of the Indian tradition and the total insensitivity to the vulgarity of it.
``The most glittering event in the whole of Nawabi Lucknow was the wedding of Nazir Ali, the adopted son of Asaf-ud-daula in 1795. It passed into Lucknow mythology since no one could match the ï¿½.300000 that Asaf-ud-daula had spent during the three nights' celebration.'' This is followed by a description of a procession of 1200 elephants, ``some with silver howdahs''.
The image of the opulence of Mughal Lucknow which was in its decadence under the creeping imperialism of the British thrown up by this description was what the Nawabs of Lucknow would have liked to project though the poverty of the people did not escape the notice of the better breed of the English. Rev. William Tennant, writing in 1798 A.D., said, ``I never witnessed so many varied forms of wretchedness, filth and vice. Vice and poverty are the only qualities these people uniformly display.''
The English, who were steadily gaining more and more influence and power in Lucknow which is the scene of the happenings in this book, were not pleased as it might be expected when they saw the Indians adopting their lifestyles and behaviour. Though it is not so very specifically stated, the English would have felt better if the Indians remained Indian since they should have felt that their becoming English was prompted by their urge to be seen as their equals. When Wajid Ali Shah, the Mughal king of Lucknow, ``admitted quite frankly that he loved the English,'' the East India Company was not pleased with his anglophilia and felt that his attachment to the English was of the ``wrong kind''. This is a manifestation of the emerging imperialist psyche. A striking illustration of how rising British power in Lucknow and in the rest of India was making it possible for the less than average breed in England to become very powerful in India is given in a chapter on the ``barber of Lucknow''. This is about George Harris Deruset who became the real power behind the Awadh throne.
A particularly illuminating chapter in the book is about Indian visitors to England and their exposure to the English ways of life and culture in the 18th century. These visitors were mostly Muslims since Hindus were discouraged by their religion from crossing the seas. Halima, a Muslim girl, who went to England, became known as the anglicised Helena Bennett who married General Benoit de Boigne. The accounts of the other Indian settlers in England - they were certainly not as many as the English who came to India - give an indication of the lure which England had at least for a few Indians and how they felt at home in that far away country of an earlier century. This chapter mentions how there were a few Englishmen like Captain William White who were very sensitive to the English being intruders in India and whose presence was a nuisance. ``We are aliens and the soil sooner or later must return into the hands of the natives.'' He was writing nearly 200 years before 1947.
Rosie Llewellyn-Jones, who has written this book half a century after the end of the British rule in India, has delved into a large number of sources for taking a fresh look at how India, in a state of political decay, was crumbling under the British onslaught. Though she does not wish to liken the decaying 18th century Lucknow she is writing about, to the legendary Sodom and Gomorrah, the comparison would indeed have been very apt because of the very poor quality of the rulers who were the successors of Babar, Shah Jehan and Aurangazeb, both in Delhi and in Lucknow.
