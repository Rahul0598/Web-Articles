Sun sign Gemini (May 21 to June 20)
Students, politicians, traders and professionals improve their fortunes. Mixed luck for realtors. An official or business travel proves beneficial. Wedding bells chime for single and eligible. Lottery events bring in minor profits. Some happiness promised for the romantic. Those in business find their partners cooperative and highly enthusiastic. You can extract work from subordinates and servants only with great difficulty.
Moon in MITHUNA (Stars - the last two quarters of Mrigasira, Arudra and the first three quarters of Punarvasu)
A mixed week for students, advocates, doctors, chartered accountants and computer professionals. Promotional transfer for some in service. Real estate dealers to lie low. Financial flows sought to hold steady. A few gains likely from luck-based games. A baby brings joy. A favourable travel is likely.
