The Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, said in Nagpur, on January 1, at a public meeting that ``to talk of bringing about a reunion of India and Pakistan at the present juncture is meaningless.'' Pandit Nehru said that at the recent Calcutta session of the Hindu Mahasabha, the President of the Sabha, had made a statement that the objective of the Sabha was to strive for the reunion of India and Pakistan into ``Akhand Bharat.''
Pandit Nehru declared that such statements were ``most irresponsible,'' and he did not imagine that any person, who considered himself as holding a position of responsibility in public life, could lightheartedly make it.
``I wish to make it perfectly clear here to-day that there is no question of Pakistan coming back to India. If India has her great and difficult problems to tackle, Pakistan is faced with even bigger and formidable problems to solve. We shall be adding to our burdens if any one talks of bringing back Pakistan to India,'' he said. Pandit Nehru continued that it was hoped that with the establishment of Pakistan, the communalism of the Muslim League had shifted to that country from India for good. He deplored that for sometime past fresh attempts were being made in India by some people to rouse communal feelings of Hindus and make them look at the problems facing this land from what he called ``a narrow and restricted'' approach.
The Prime Minister asserted that in a democracy - and in India they had pledged themselves to a democratic from of Government - there was no room for communalism.
