ISLAMABAD, JAN. 3. Pakistan said today that in the absence of profiles of the hijackers it would be ``difficult'' to apprehend them if they entered the country through an ``unauthorised route''.
``The Indian officials reportedly conducted the negotiations (with the hijackers of the Indian plane) through specialised equipment which they had flown to Kandahar. If the officials obtained some particulars about the hijackers, these have not been disclosed to facilitate identification. No one else listened to the dialogue between the Indians and the hijackers,'' the statement said.
``Those who suggest Pakistan should arrest the hijackers make the naive assumption that the hijackers have entered Pakistan. To the best of our information, such an assumption is unwarranted,'' it said.
Pakistan also said that new allegations were being hurled at it by India without a ``shred'' of evidence. ``Earlier, the Indian Airlines published the list of passengers aboard the hijacked plane. It did not include any Pakistani nationals. The baseless allegation now can only expose India's prejudice and malevolence not to mention ingratitude for the cooperation of authorities extended throughout the hijacking crisis.''
``The Indian (External Affairs) Minister (Mr. Jaswant Singh) did not desist from attributing a false statement to the Information Minister of Afghanistan. The latter has clarified that he did not say that the hijackers had left Afghanistan for Quetta in Pakistan,'' the statement claimed.
(The Pakistani newspaper Jang quoted the Taliban Information Minister, Mr. Abdul Hae Mutmaen, as saying on Saturday that all five hijackers and the three released militants had left for Quetta from Kandahar. The Taliban ``denied'' this report a full 36 hours later).
The Pakistani Foreign Office also claimed that ``immediate instructions'' had been issued to all immigration check-points in Balochistan and the Frontier province to ``arrest persons bearing the names of the hijackers announced by the Indian Government if they sought entry into Pakistan''. So far, the Government of Pakistan claimed, ``no such person had presented himself at any of the check-points''.
``The Indian Government has so far given no details as to the profiles of the hijackers. In the absence of such details, it would be difficult to apprehend the culprits if they enter Pakistan by an unauthorised route. Nevertheless, our authorities will maintain strict vigilance and make utmost efforts to arrest and investigate persons who look suspicious,'' the statement said.
``The Government is cognisant of its obligations under ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) conventions. Due action will be taken in case the hijackers come into its custody,'' it added.
The Pakistani Foreign Minister, Mr. Abdul Sattar, meanwhile, alleged that India had tried to ``get American sympathies'' on account of the hijacking episode. He was quoted as saying by a Pakistani news agency that the hijackers had not entered Pakistan. ``Under the international (laws) dealing with terrorism, we will arrest them and put them before (a) court,'' Mr. Sattar maintained.
