Sir, - As long as Pakistan abets terrorism in the name of the Kashmir issue, our country will face hijack problems. Let the External Affairs Ministry take the initiative and convince all nations to sign a comprehensive treaty agreeing that a) no pilot or co-pilot would take off at the dictates of hijackers even when they start killing passengers/crew members or threaten to blow up the plane, b) no nation would allow any unscheduled landing of a hijacked plane at any of its airports on the plea of fuel- refilling or other excuses, c) and no official including that of the U.N. would talk directly or indirectly to any hijacker, let alone conceding his demands even if VIP passengers are aboard.
The hijackers of the IA plane behaved only after the Taliban warned them of commando action if they physically harmed anyone on board. Dealing sternly with the hijackers and making it clear that their demands will not be met will act as a deterrent.

Sir, - It is amply clear that Pakistan is behind the IA aircraft hijacking. We must immediately ban all Pakistan-registered aircraft from overflying India. This action will result in its civilian flights taking circuitous routes. But India will not be affected by similar action by Pakistan.
In the mid-Sixties and early Seventies, the United States and Israel posted well-trained commandos on all civilian flights which were prone to hijacking. The commandos travelled as regular passengers. This measure considerably reduced the hijack threat.
