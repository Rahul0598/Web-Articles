CHENNAI, JAN. 3. The All India Christian Council is raising nearly Rs. 10 crores for a rehabilitation project in the cyclone- devastated Orissa.
The council president, Dr. Joseph De Souza, and the spokesman, Mr. John Dayal, told reporters today that four model villages were proposed to be built in two blocks of Cuttack district. Each village would have 250 houses. The rehabilitation would provide basic infrastructure in the blocks.
The council, an umbrella organisation of Churches and Christian NGOs, would bear the entire cost from its funds without seeking any matching grant from the State administration. It would bring in state-of-the-art technology in setting up adequate early warning systems and cyclone shelters in the coastal belt.
The emphasis would be on the sustainability of the project by providing avenues for local employment, health and education centres, besides roads, communication systems and drinking water facilities, would be set up, they said. The council would be willing to participate in long-term comprehensive plans for ensuring maximum benefit to the maximum number of people.
The rehabilitations would be accompanied by a literacy and medicare campaign, they added.
In a separate statement, the council, along with the All India Catholic Union, the Muslim Coordination Committee of Tamil Nadu and the Makkal Sewak Sangh, condemned ``attempts by vested interests'' to divide India's minority communities.
It called for peace in Bangalore, where the members of the Muslim community had demonstrated against a newspaper for carrying an ``offensive'' article. ``Any continuation of violence will be playing into the hands of the vested interests,'' the council said.
It appealed to the Press Council of India, the Editors Guild and other media organisations to ensure that ``freedom of expression was not jeopardised by a small section of people who were making political capital out of their attacks on Christians, Muslims and Dalits.''
Mr. John Dayal, while objecting to Mr. Arun Shourie's continuance in the Union Ministry, wanted the Prime Minister to clarify whether he endorsed Mr. Shourie's writings that defamed Muslims, Christians and Dalits.
He also urged the Chief Minister, Mr. M. Karunanidhi, to take up this issue with the Prime Minister.
