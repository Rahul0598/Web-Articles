PONDICHERRY, DEC. 31. A special meeting of the Cabinet headed by Chief Minister, Mr. R. V. Janakiraman, was held here on Friday and a resolution was adopted to once again appeal to the centre to refrain from applying the uniform sales tax in the union territory of Pondicherry.
Stating this at a hurriedly-convened press conference, Mr. Janakiraman said that he would take a delegation of all the Ministers, the two MPs from Pondicherry, legislators and representatives of the fraternal parties to New Delhi on January 5 to meet the Prime Minister, Union Home and Finance Ministers to present again to them that the union terriory was totally opposed to the new system of taxation.
The Cabinet meeting was held within hours of the all-party meeting convened by the Chief Minister, which had failed. No unanimous decision could be reached at the all-party meet as the demand for special session of Assembly to adopt a resolution against Centre's decision, was made again.
The political party leaders also asserted that the Chief Minister accompany the delegation proposed to be taken by the opposition to New Delhi on January 5 as DMK representative and not as Chief Minister. Both these demands were rejected by the Chief Minister.
