PERTH, JAN. 2. Pakistan crashed to a 52-run defeat in a one-day clash against Australia `A' at the WACA ground on Sunday night.
Hungry for an early victory after its 3-0 Test drubbing by Australia in this country late last year, Pakistan failed despite a marvellous 100 not out by No. 6 batsman Azhar Mahmood in 89 balls, with fourteen powerful boundaries.
It was the first of the three warm-up matches for the tourist before the lucrative triangular limited-overs contest also featuring Australia and India starting next Sunday.
Australia `A,' put in to bat, made 281 for nine in 50 overs. In its chase Pakistan could score only 229 as Australia `A' skipper Shane Lee starred with the ball, taking four for 32 from six overs with his medium-pacers.
The game slipped out of Pakistan's grasp early as Australia `A' openers Matthew Hayden (128) and David Fitzgerald (85) hit 191 as they mauled an attack which looked painfully innocuous without the lightning pace of Akhtar. Hayden, not considered good enough to warrant an Australian senior role, pounded his runs from 115 balls, helped by two towering 6s and seventeen 4s.
The match was 33.2 overs old before Pakistan struck its first blow with Shoaib Malik ousting Fitzgerald. Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq saved Pakistan to some degree with 10 beautifully flighted overs which earned him five for 40 as the home team's middle order and tail caved in.
In its big chase, Pakistan skidded to an embarrassing 82 for six in the 19th over before Mahmood and Abdur Razzak (35) injected some steel into the innings.
They cracked an enterprising 81 from 82 balls before Razzak departed.
