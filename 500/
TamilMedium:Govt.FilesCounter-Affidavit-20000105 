CHENNAI, JAN. 4. The Government has the power to regulate, modify, introduce any particular language as medium of instruction and implementing any scheme concerning the field of education, insofar as nursery and primary schools are concerned, the State Government has contended.
In its counter-affidavit to the batch of petitions challenging the G.O dated November 19, 1999, making Tamil or the mothertongue as medium of instruction in all schools in the State, the Government said the move would not harm anyone, nor infringe any person's fundamental right.
It was a myth to say that parents of the children wanted their children to study in English medium. By saying so, the people running nursery schools were trying to encash the situation by forcing parents to admit their wards in English medium schools, where huge sums were collected as tuition fees.
The counter affidavit filed by Mr.M.P. Vijayakumar, Additional Secretary, School Education Department, stated that all along parents had to admit the children in English medium schools regardless of their option; whereas after the issue of the G.O., ``the patriotic parents will only be too happy to welcome the policy of the government to introduce Tamil as medium of instruction in all nursery and primary schools''. It was incorrect to state that the power vested with the schools to choose the instruction medium, it added. The Constitution emphasised the State's duty to offer free and compulsory education and clothed the government implicitly with regulatory powers.
Also, it enjoined every State to facilitate the instruction in mother tongue at primary stage. So the averment by various associations of private and matriculation schools that the government should not interfere in their affairs, since they received no grant, was untenable. The Government had absolute powers to regulate the educational system by passing appropriate orders.
The government also defended its move, stating that because of English medium education, a new generation of students not knowing the mother tongue, alien to their own culture, was emerging. Therefore traditional values were at stake. Further, Tamil scholars and savants made a hue and cry that Tamil should be only instruction medium upto Standard V and English taught as a language only to the students from Standard VI.
Considering these factors, and also on the recommendations of the Justice Mohan Commission, the Government introduced Tamil medium. Denying the averment from school managements that the move would lead to children joining CBSE and Anglo Indian schools, the Government said it was an untenable argument as such the latter group were few and far confined to only urban areas.
The case being heard by a specially constituted Division Bench is likely to come up on January 10.
