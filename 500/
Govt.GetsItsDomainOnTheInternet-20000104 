THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, JAN. 3. The State Government has obtained registered ownership of its domain on the Internet, .
When the Government registered its web portal in the U.S. last year, the domain got registered in the name of a private agency in Kottayam which arranged for the registration. Now, the registration has been transferred to the Government agency, Centre for Development of Imaging Technology (C-DIT).
However, the C-DIT's own domain, cdit.org, continues to be registered in the name of the private agency. So also is several other websites of the Government such as that of the Industries Department and public sector undertakings such as the Kerala Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) and the Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited.
The Kerala Police, however, have transferred its domain in the name of the Director General of Police. Mr. G. Jayaraj of C-DIT said the centre planned to get the registration of the domain transferred to its name shortly. This was not being done immediately considering the costs.
(The cost of registering a domain in the U.S. is about $ 30 now. Earlier, this was about $ 100. Domain registration is currently free in India.)
The administrative or technical contact for these Government and PSU sites continues to be with the proprietor of the private agency in Kottayam.
In the case of the web portal, Mr. G. Jayaraj of C-DIT has been named as the Administrative and Billing contact now.
However, the owner of the private agency is named as the technical contact. In cases where his name appears as the administrative contact, the technical contact is the agency which maintains the server in America.
The registrations are with Network Solutions, one of the registrars for domain names in the U.S.
The Government has plans to move its portal to servers of the National Informatics Centre shortly though the site would continue to be mirrored in the U.S. under the current address.
The Government might also consider setting up of web servers in Thiruvananthapuram itself. The poor infrastructure in Thiruvananthapuram is cited as a reason by the C-DIT against the establishment of web servers in Thiruvananthapuram.
However, more than a few hundred research institutions and private agencies maintain web servers in India.
A few servers function from Kerala also. Though the absence of high speed lines is a handicap, they manage because the hits are not on a high level.
Currently, about 25 public sector agencies and a few Government departments in Kerala are having websites. Hardly any of them get a hundred hits a day.
Most Keralites could not access these sites owing to poor infrastructure in the State. Some point out that the establishment of web servers in Kerala could at least spur development of the infrastructure, if not reduce the costs in the long run.
Besides, the Government departments can have Indian top level domain reserved for the Government (.gov.in) instead of American commercial domains (.com).
There is also the view that the Government is actually wasting tax payers' money by registering domains in the U.S. and renting server space there except for departments like Tourism and Industries.
One megabyte of free web space is available with the VSNL for every Internet account the Government is having with the former.
This could be used by many Government agencies which currently do not have content in excess of 1 MB.
The Agency for Non-conventional Energy Sources and the Kerala Horticulture Development Project have shown the way in this regard.
This is also a facility that several educational institutions of the Government can make use of. Currently, the access time of these websites is pretty good.
Pages can be fetched from the U.S. in a few seconds. The only disadvantage is that an agency could not have its own domain name.
Meanwhile, a Malayali in New York has registered a domain under the name keralagovernment.com. He has not set up a site yet.
If sites with similar names come up, they have the potential to confuse surfers. Already the domain name of the Government confuses many outsiders as it is registered as a commercial domain. Additional commercial names carrying the Kerala Government name would add to the confusion.
