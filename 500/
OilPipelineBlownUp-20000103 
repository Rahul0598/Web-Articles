GUWAHATI, JAN. 2.Militants of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) blew up a portion of an ONGC pipeline near Disang bridge in Assam's Sibsagar district last night, causing oil spillage and fire.
The spillage was in an area of about 150 X 30 feet and the oil movement was stopped immediately.
The fire raged for an hour before it was doused, but no harm was done to the area, an isolated spot with no villages nearby, the Sibsagar Deputy Commissioner said.
The explosion followed a recent announcement by ULFA to carry out subversive activities this month.
But as the damaged line had no connection with supply of oil to the refineries and normal activities of ONGC were not affected.
