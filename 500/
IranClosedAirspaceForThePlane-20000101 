TEHERAN, DEC. 31. Iran announced today it had closed its air space to the hijacked Indian Airlines airbus parked for the last week at the airport in Kandahar, without explaining if there had been any request to land in the country.
``Iran will not authorise under any condition the hijacked plane to enter or even cross its air space,'' said a statement issued by the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation, quoted by the IRNA news agency.
