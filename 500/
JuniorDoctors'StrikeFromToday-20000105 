HYDERABAD, JAN. 4. The A.P. Junior Doctors Association has announced that its members in all medical colleges and Government hospitals will go on an indefinite strike from January 5 protesting against the Government's refusal to concede their demands.
The strike would be observed for the first two days only in wards and outpatient departments and would be extended to emergency services later if the Government does not concede the junior doctors' demands.
The call was given after failure of talks between the association's representatives and the Health Secretary, Mrs. Rachel Chatterjee, on the demands of junior doctors.
