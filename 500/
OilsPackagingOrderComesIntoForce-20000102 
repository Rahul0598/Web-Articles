CHENNAI, JAN.1.The Tamil Nadu Government has decided not to grant further extension for different kinds of edible oils for purposes of implementation of the Edible Oils Packaging (Regulation) Order notified by the Central Government on September 17, 1998.
According to an official release, the regulations were intended to ensure the availability of quality oil as well as in correct measure to the general public.
The power to enforce the order had been delegated to the state governments. Under this order, the States will register packers and ensure inspection and sampling through its own field staff.
Though the notification was re-published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Order dated December 14, 1998, the Government had granted exemption in packaging for groundnut oil and palmolein oil upto December 31, 1999, and in respect of gingelly oil, coconut oil, soyabean oil, sunflower oil and saffola oil upto January 31, 2000, in the interest of the general public, especially the poorer sections who may find it difficult to bear the cost of packaged oils.
``Since organised adulteration of edible oils in different parts of the country with substances which are non- edible and very injurious to health takes place and as RBD palmolein oil is being mixed with groundnut oil and coconut oil in several parts of the country, the Government has decided not to grant exemption beyond December 31, 1999, for groundnut oil and RBD palmolein oils and January 31, 2000, for other oils like gingelly oil, coconut oil, soyabean oil, sunflower oil and saffola oil``, says the release.
