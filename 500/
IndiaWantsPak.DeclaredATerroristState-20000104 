PUNE, JAN. 3. The Prime Minister, Mr. A. B. Vajpayee, today openly accused Pakistan of having been behind the recent hijack of the Indian Airlines aircraft and said the Government would work systematically to ensure that major nations of the world declared Pakistan a terrorist state. India expected the U.S. to take the initiative in this direction.
At his first press conference after the resolution of the weeklong hijack, Mr. Vajpayee said all the information now available with the Government about the hijack and the subsequent developments made it clear that it was an integral part of the Pakistan-backed campaign of terrorism. Apart from their stated demands, the hijackers and their mentors had planned to internationalise the Kashmir issue and isolate India diplomatically.
They, however, failed miserably in their ``diabolical design'', he said, and if anything got internationalised during the crisis, it was not the Kashmir issue, but the brazen resort to terrorism by those seeking to break India's unity and integrity.
The Prime Minister, who was here to inaugurate the 87th Indian Science Congress, said the hijack had been universally condemned by Governments and peoples around the world. Thus, rather than India, it was the anti-India forces behind the terrorist act which would have got isolated in the eyes of the world.
The development has vastly furthered India's long-term interest. It has strengthened the legitimacy of India's traditional stand on Kashmir and simultaneously shown the world that Pakistan's Kashmir agenda was not only baseless, but was being pursued by recourse to terrorism, which constituted a patent threat to global security. The involvement of Pakistan's ISI was all the more confirmed by the incident in Nepal last evening, he added. (A Pakistani diplomat has reportedly been arrested for possessing fake Indian currency).
Mr. Vajpayee, however, parried a question on reports that Britain would allow entry to Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh, who was among the three militants released by India in exchange for the freedom of the hostages, and who happens to be a British national of Pakistani origin. ``No comments,'' he said, when asked about these London-based reports.
On the Taliban, the Prime Minister, said its role in the episode was yet to be assessed fully. At Kandahar, its attitude was helpful towards India; a better understanding had developed between India and the Taliban authorities. But, they were also sympathetic to the hijackers. We are awaiting more information, he said.
Asked specifically whether Taliban had supplied arms to the hijackers, Mr. Vajpayee confirmed that it was true that the hijackers had a fresh set of weapons. But, it was possible that they had been hidden in the aircraft earlier and it was also possible that they had got it from ``outside''. The matter is presently under investigation.
The Prime Minister refuted criticism that the Government had bowed before the hijackers and had compromised on national security and said the release of militants for the hostages in the present case was far different from what happened during the V. P. Singh Government, when five militants were released in exchange for the daughter of the then Home Minister, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed.
At the time, there was only one hostage. But, now, the number of the hostages was quite large. The presence of children and women among them also made the task difficult, he said, and reiterated that though the demand was for the release of 36 militants the Government accepted to release only three of them. We had no other option, he said. Moreover, none of the hostages was related to any Minister, he said.
Mr. Vajpayee also refuted allegations that there were differences within the Cabinet over the manner in which the incident was handled. There was absolutely no dissent.
There was a unanimity of views, he said, and added that the Home Minister, Mr. L. K. Advani, was fully involved in all the discussions and also attended the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security, where the decision to exchange the militants for the hostages was taken. Reports of resignation, or for that matter any other letter, were totally baseless, he said.
Mr. Vajpayee agreed that the security at the Kathmandu airport had been lax.
