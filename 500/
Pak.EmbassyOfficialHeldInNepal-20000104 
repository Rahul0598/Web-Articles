NEW DELHI, JAN. 3. The Nepalese police have nabbed a Pakistani Embassy official in Kathmandu for allegedly smuggling counterfeit currency into India.
The details of the ``sting operation'' have appeared in today's edition of the local newspaper Kathmandu Post. The Foreign Office has confirmed the authenticity of the report.
Mr. Asim Saboor, a clerk in the Pakistani Embassy, is alleged to have been caught by the Nepalese police with banknotes worth Rs. 50,000 in Rs. 500 denomination.
Sources here said the Pakistani official was allegedly involved in the conspiracy to smuggle around 20 kg of RDX into India by a Sikh militant, Lakhbir Singh, in November 1998. In addition, Mr. Arshad Cheema, a First Secretary in the consular wing of the Pakistani Mission, was seen at the airport on the day of the hijacking, and allegedly played a role in the incident. Disembarking from an Embassy car - No. 42 CD 14 -, Mr. Cheema is understood to have walked into the airport prior to the takeoff with Mr. Zia Ansari, an assistant in the Consular section. Mr. Cheema allegedly entered the departure area with a bag which was not checked because of his diplomatic immunity.
The spokesman said the Pakistani Ambassador in Nepal and other officers made an attempt to prevent action against Mr. Saboor on grounds of diplomatic immunity. According to the Kathmandu Post, a Pakistani official, Mr. Mohammed Raza Jalil, Second Secretary, also asked police not to report the incident to the press as it would setback Nepal-Pakistan relations. But Mr. Saboor was arrested by the police as he did not enjoy diplomatic immunity. According to the newspaper report, the undercover operation which resulted in Mr. Saboor's detention was mounted two weeks ago when police arrested two persons with 15 kg of contraband near Kathmandu. A fake Rs. 500 note was recovered from one of them.
The press report says that a woman police inspector was sent in as an undercover agent to establish contact with Mr. Saboor. She offered to buy Rs. 50,000 of the fake Indian currency in return for an equivalent amount in Nepalese rupees. The agent was then instructed by Mr. Saboor to meet him at a particular location in Kathmandu. As per plans, she asked for additional amount of fake currency and was told by Mr. Saboor that he was in possession of Rs. 20 million in his apartment. The two of them then visited Mr. Saboor's residence.
When the undercover agent confronted Mr. Saboor brandishing a revolver and asked Mr. Saboor to surrender he invoked his ``diplomatic status'' and locked himself up. Soon after, police saw smoke coming out of the apartment amid suspicions that Mr. Saboor was burning the currency notes.
