Sun sign Aquarius (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
Politicians, professionals and students must not miss the bus. Those in real estate face ups-and-downs. Regulate financial outflows to avoid mismatch with income. Postpone new ventures, speculative dealings and romance. Be cautious in discussions with business partners. Avoid controversy. Business-people must be careful not to over-stock. A young one in the family may come under the weather.
Moon in KUMBHA (Stars - the last two quarters of Dhanishta, Satabhishak, and the first three quarters of Poorvabhadrapada)
A prosperous spell for industrialists and contractors. Professionals, sportspersons, students and traders do well. Government personnel face an unwarranted shift. Politicians face fluctuating winds. Finances should be fairly sufficient. Legal and court proceedings may arise over a family property. A heart- to-heart talk with older children will help you understand them better. Be cautious with business partners.
