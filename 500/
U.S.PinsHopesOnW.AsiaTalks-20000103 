WASHINGTON, JAN. 2. With Israel and Syria getting together for their tough negotiating sessions starting on Wednesday, there is no doubt that senior officials of the Clinton administration will be with the teams all the way.
The President, Mr. Bill Clinton, is expected to be at the start of the first session at Sheperdstown, West Virginia; and both the Secretary of State, Ms. Madeleine Albright, and the top West Asia negotiator, Mr. Dennis Ross, will be available throughout, it is being maintained.
As in the case of any sensitive and high profile involvement of the United States - Camp David or the Wye Plantations, for instance - the venue for the Israel-Syria talks has been deliberately chosen. It is a semi-secluded spot some 90 miles from Washington D.C. where the two teams and the Clinton administration can do some real talking in the absence of the media crowd. From a security standpoint too Sheperdstown will be easier to manage than any downtown location. Most important is that of proximity to the nation's capital.
The administration and the White House have made it clear that a peace accord between these two critical West Asia States is a very high foreign policy priority for this year; and there is no doubt that Mr. Clinton would like to see a comprehensive West Asia peace as a part of the history books and his eight-year legacy by the time he steps down formally in January 2001. Washington has played a key mediating role in West Asia, but none is under any illusion of what is on hand right now.
For the last four years the Israelis and the Syrians have been deadlocked in the negotiations over the Golan Heights. The two sides even disagree over where the talks broke off; what had been agreed upon or even where it all should begin.
But the recent meeting here in December 1999 between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Syrian Foreign Minister did go the distance in breaking the ice, although no firm commitments have been made.
Syria is demanding that all of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967 must be returned in return for ``peace,'' the terms of which is yet to be clearly spelt out.
The Jewish State is demanding security guarantees and the two sides would have to work out the future of some 18,000 Jews who are said to be living in the Golan Heights.
The U.S. has said in very broad terms that it is willing to ``fund'' a peace settlement, although no one is sure what the price tag is going to be.
Some argue that the price tag for peace between Israel and Syria would be anywhere between $10 and $20 billions; and the money for this has to be appropriated by Congress. But the problem is also that Syria is one of the nations listed by the State Department as officially sponsoring terrorism.
