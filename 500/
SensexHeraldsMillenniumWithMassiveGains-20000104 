The Indian markets are attractive as far as valuations are concerned. Software boom has been going on almost 18 months and likely to continue. Once the Y2K problem has been sorted out, the markets look pretty attractive to the foreign investors. ``The markets are expected to open on a firm note and there could be an intra-day correction,'' said a stock broker. However, bullish undertone would remain for at least next quarter.
Many B1 and B2 segments also hit upper circuit. Another non-IT top gainer was SAIL which closed at Rs. 39.30 compared to Rs. 11.25. HCL Infosys closed at Rs. 754.60 compared to Rs. 698 in the previous close.
