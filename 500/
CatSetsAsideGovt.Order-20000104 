CHENNAI, JAN. 3. The Chennai Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal has set aside a government order refusing to expunge the `adverse' remarks in the annual confidential report (ACR) of Mr.S.P. Mathur, an IPS officer, in the rank of Inspector-General of Police.
Directing the expunction of the adverse remarks, the Bench asked the Union and State Home Secretaries to open the sealed cover pertaining to Mr. Mathur's promotion, which was kept pending in view of the charge framed against him, and to act according to law.
The action of the (then) State Home Secretary making an adverse remark in the ACR (as the accepting authority) without any material on record, when the reporting and reviewing authorities had considered Mr. Mathur's overall record as `outstanding', could be considered nothing short of ``perverse in nature'', the Bench, comprising Vice-Chairman, Mr.K.S. Bakthavatsalam and Administrative Member, Mr.S. Bapu, noted.
The ACR of Mr. Mathur, for the period of December 1997 to March 1998, when he was member secretary, TN Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB), had a remark, stating that he was responsible for the delay in issuing the notification of advertisement for recruiting constables and SIs. Only after his explanation was called for he had acted. ``The officer should take responsibility and be dynamic and result-oriented''.
Denying the charge, Mr. Mathur said twice he represented to the Government to expunge the remarks, but the plea was rejected.
Challenging this action, the officer said if the ACR was read as a whole, there was a contradiction between the adverse entry and the rest of the report. It had become a bar for his promotion as Additional DGP, while his junior had been promoted as ADGP in August 1999, causing damage to his reputation and loss of honour.
The Government countered that as TNUSRB member- secretary, he was responsible for the overall administration including the recruitment process. He had failed in his fundamental duty to publish the notification immediately. His lapse led to a delay in the recruitment process.
The Bench said that as per the Board's rules, there was no direct administrative responsibility fixed on a member secretary for issuing the recruitment notification. If it was so, the act of the accepting authority, that was State Home Secretary, in making an adverse entry holding that the applicant alone was responsible for the delay, was misplaced and arbitrary.
The Home Secretary's act of inventing the concept of delay for an isolated activity of issuing notification, for making an adverse entry, was unwarranted, the Bench said. It was clear from the facts that the draft notification was kept pending with the government for over three months. All of a sudden in March 1998, Mr. Mathur was instructed to publish the notification. So the delay was only at the government level. Holding that Mr. Mathur was made a scapegoat for the delay which occurred elsewhere, the Bench set aside the impugned order.
