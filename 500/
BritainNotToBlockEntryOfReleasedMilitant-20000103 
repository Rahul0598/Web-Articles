LONDON, JAN. 2. Britain will not refuse entry to Islamic militant Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh, who was among the three militants released by India in exchange for the freedom of 155 hostages on board the hijacked Indian Airlines plane.
A British national of Pakistani origin, Sheikh was detained in New Delhi in 1994 and is awaiting trial.
The British Foreign Office had been providing him with consular protection.
A Foreign Office spokesman said last night Britain would not refuse him entry as he had not been convicted by any court.
The family of Sheikh, a Harkat-ul-Ansar militant, has been in touch with the Foreign Office since his arrest, the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, sources said Sheikh was unlikely to come to Britain immediately as he might be extradited from here in the event of a court in India convicting him in cases connected with terrorism.
