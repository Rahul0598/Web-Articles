ISLAMABAD, DEC. 31. ``It is a major defeat for the Government of India,'' the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil, told TheHindu in response to the information that New Delhi had decided to release three militants in exchange for the freedom of hostages.
The Maulana, who ``condemned'' the hijacking incident, however, said the Indian Government had suffered a major ``setback''. Maulana Masood Azhar, one of the militants released in exchange for the hostages, was linked to the Harkat-ul-Ansar, previous identity of the Harkat-ul- Mujahideen.
Asked about the identity of the hijackers, the Maulana claimed that most of them were Indian nationals - both Hindus and Sikhs. He denied that the Harkat was in any way linked to the hijacking.
When this correspondent spoke to him at 4 p.m. IST, the Maulana supplied the name of the third militant - Mohammed Umar - to be released along with Maulana Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar alias Latram.
Asked which group Mohammad Umar belonged to, he said one should leave groups aside.
