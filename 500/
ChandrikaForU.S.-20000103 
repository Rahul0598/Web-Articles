COLOMBO, JAN. 2. The Sri Lankan President, Ms. Chandrika Kumaratunga, is likely to leave for the United States shortly for further medical consultations and treatment for her right eye which, according to medical opinion, could have suffered permanent loss of sight when she survived an assassination attempt by a suicide bomber on December 18.
Sources said Ms. Kumaratunga's programme was likely to be finalised after crucial political and administrative decisions were taken.
These include a possible Cabinet reshuffle and high-level appointments at the administrative level. Also to be considered is the possibility of calling for an early Parliamentary poll.
The visit to the U.S is being contemplated in the backdrop of a recent visit to Britain, where doctors informed Ms. Kumaratunga that she had probably lost the sight in the right eye.
