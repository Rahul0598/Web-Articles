MEERUT, DEC. 31. Security at railway stations and along railway lines in western Uttar Pradesh has been tightened following recovery of a transistor bomb outside the movement control office of Meerut Cantonment railway station today.
About 60 clips were found removed from the track near Mewla crossing yesterday minutes before the Khurja Passenger train was to pass through the area.
These and incidents in Bijnore and Moradabad districts over the past three months, senior intelligence officials felt, pointed towards anti-national elements attempting to create havoc in the region which has been comparatively calm over the past one year.
The intelligence officials blamed the railways and the police for not paying heed to repeated warnings that anti-national elements suspected to be working at the behest of Pakistan's ISI were trying hard to disturb peace in the region.
