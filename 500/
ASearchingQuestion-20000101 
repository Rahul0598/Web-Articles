Sir, - This happened about three years ago. Three professors including myself were waiting at the Patna airport for our baggage to be scanned before we boarded an Indian Airlines aircraft to go to Lucknow. But no scanning was done and, asked about it, an official of the Airport Authority said, ``We are short of hands; therefore, there will be no scanning. I am attending to the important duty of arranging for lunch for the passengers on board''.
When I argued that baggage scanning and security check of all passengers were paramount in air travel, he was in no mood to listen and left the scene. Luckily, nothing untoward happened on our flight.
As a frequent air traveller, let me tell you about the security measures taken in other countries. In July 1989, I was in Paris; the baggage was scanned at the airport before I left for London. Again, the baggage was subjected to a thorough check at Heathrow before I emplaned for Chennai. Even my camera was examined.
In India, security is not a prime concern, particularly on domestic flights. When things are this bad in India, I wouldn't expect Nepal to be more careful about security in air travel. The price?

Sir, - The terrorist leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen was under arrest in this country for over five years. Had he been tried or were charges framed against him at all? Successive Governments floundered on this issue. It required the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane and the holding of over 150 lives hostage for the Government to wake up from slumber.
Another question. How did the Indian Airlines staff at Kathmandu issue four boarding passes to a single person? Should they not be awarded exemplary punishment for their serious lapse?
If it is true that the hijackers hopped from a PIA aircraft and boarded the IA flight at Kathmandu, how were they, in the first place, allowed at Lahore to carry weapons with them?
