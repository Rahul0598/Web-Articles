NEW DELHI, JAN 4. A meeting of the Congress(I) Working Committee has been called on Thursday. The post-hijacking scenario and the Government's handling of the crisis are expected to be discussed.
The Congress(I) has been severely critical of the Government's crisis management and has already demanded an explanation on why the plane was allowed to fly out of Amritsar; why the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh, escorted the three terrorists (exchanged for the hostages) to Kandahar; and why it took as long as 40 minutes for the Prime Minister to be informed of the hijacking.
