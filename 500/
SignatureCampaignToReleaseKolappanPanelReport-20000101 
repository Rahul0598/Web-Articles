CHENNAI, DEC. 31. Agricultural workers under the banner of the CPI in Tamil Nadu have launched a state-wide signature campaign to press the Government to make public the Kolappan Committee report, which went into a host of welfare measures for the farm labourers.
The panel had made nearly 60 recommendations including pension for agriculture labour, but the Government has only confined itself to announcing the revised minimum wages for farm labour, Mr.R.Mutharasan, general secretary of the CPI-affiliated Tamil Nadu Agriculture Workers Union, said.
Barring Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, where the CPI's agriculture wing is strong, he said in other districts the revised wages were hardly in vogue, particularly for women. ``We want the implementation of the Committee's report in toto,'' he said and added that they were confident of getting over one lakh signatures in composite Thanjavur district alone.
The Workers Union, which reviewed the follow-up action to the Committee's report at its Council meeting in Srivalliputtur recently, has decided to step up this campaign in stages, he said. In the month of February 2000, protest meetings would be held in different parts of the State to highlight their demands.
Mr.Mutharasan said this will be followed by a ``continuous picketing agitation'' before Government Offices in March next. The date for its commencement will be announced after the Budget session of the Assembly was convened, Mr.Mutharasan added.
The CPI Students wing state secretary, Mr.D.Lenin, has said in a statement that they will organise a pledge-taking throughout the State tomorrow ``with candle in hand'' to proclaim the students' ``right to education'' and to press the Government to ensure the same at the beginning of the new millennium itself.
