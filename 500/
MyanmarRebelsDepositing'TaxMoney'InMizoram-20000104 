AIZAWL, JAN.3. Myanmar rebels working mainly for the Chin National Army (CNA) were depositing huge amounts, illegally collected as tax money from the Chin independent state, at their Mizoram-based ``information centre'', the Home Ministry said today.
A note by the Ministry, said self-styled Sergeant Pawnge of the CNA had deposited Rs. 30,000 at the organisation's ``information centre'' on December 15, last year.
According to the note, the Chin rebels, fighting for a sovereign state within Myanmar, were collecting tax mainly from transporters and businessmen operating near the Indian border.
The tax money was mainly being used to buy weapons to sustain their fight against the military Junta of Myanmar. ``Part of the money is also being used to bring out anti-Government literature,'' a senior Home Ministry official said.
