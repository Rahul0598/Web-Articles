TAUPO, JAN. 4. New Zealand romped to a seven-wicket win in the second one-day International against the West Indies on Tuesday in a day-night match to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
The home side reached the target of 193 with more than seven overs to spare in the match reduced to 42 overs-a-side because of a late start due to rain.
