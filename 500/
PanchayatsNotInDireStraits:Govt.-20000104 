CHENNAI, JAN. 3. Contrary to some political parties in Tamil Nadu sounding an alarming note on the ``dismal finances'' of the rural local bodies in the State, the overall funds flow, particularly to village panchayats, have grown almost ten-fold in the last five years.
Refuting impressions of a resource crunch faced by the panchayat institutions, official sources told `The Hindu here today that in the current year half the State Finance Commission's (SFC) grants of Rs.484 crore, namely Rs.242 crore, for the first and second quarters had already been released, even as the pay-outs for the third quarter, ending December 1999, is in full-swing.
Stating that the funds are normally released in the last month of each quarter, the sources said following a procedural change this year, by which the District Collectors concerned have been authorised to disburse the funds directly to the local bodies, some panchayats had delayed their submission of bills.
In each district three sets of bills are to be presented to the Collector, corresponding to the village panchayats, panchayat unions and district panchayats. This change has done away with the earlier procedure, in vogue till last year, of the Director of Rural Development, in Chennai, drawing the funds and disbursing them to the local bodies.
In addition to the SFC grants, each district in the State has been given Rs.20 lakhs to help weaker panchayats to clear their electricity bills and water dues, the sources said and hoped that in listing their expenditure panchayats would henceforth get their priorities straight.
Further, unlike other states, Tamil Nadu has simplified the procedure with one enabling order that authorises the Collectors to directly release the funds to the local bodies throughout the year, instead of release of every instalment requiring a prior G.O., the sources said.
``People hardly know the extent of money that is flowing into the rural local bodies,'' the sources said, pointing out to a total of nearly Rs.1800 Crore that finds its way to them annually at current taxation levels.
Apart from the Rs.484 Crores of SFC grants, which mainly goes to meet the operational expenses of the rural local bodies, this huge sum includes Rs.71.83 Crores by way of Centre's Tenth Finance Commission grants for capital expenditure and ``scheme grants'' of Rs.600 crores and Rs.500 crores from the state and Central governments respectively, the sources said.
While the 12,600-odd village panchayats in the State netted Rs.34.64 Crores in 1994-95 from tax and non-tax sources besides grant releases, in 1999-2000, the funds flow to them from these sources will be Rs.303.97 Crore, the sources said in asserting that panchayats were not starved of funds.
The total funds accruing to the 385 panchayat unions in the State has grown from Rs.80.13 Crores in 1994-95 to Rs.239.68 Crores in 1998-99. The 28 district panchayats formed in 1995-96 got Rs.1 crore that year, but last year they received Rs.40.52 crores.
