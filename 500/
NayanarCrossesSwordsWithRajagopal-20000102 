THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, JAN. 1. The Chief Minister, Mr. E. K. Nayanar, has questioned the Union Minister of State for Law, Mr. O. Rajagopal's reported observation that Kerala was a safe haven for extremists.
In a statement here today, Mr. Nayanar termed the statement ``baseless and irresponsible'' and asked Mr. Rajagopal to first study the information available with the Central Government regarding the law and order situation in Kerala before making such statements. The Centre, he said, was unlikely to have views similar to those expressed by Mr. Rajagopal. The Chief Minister recalled that at the conference of DGPs convened by the Home Minister, Mr. L. K. Advani, there was not even mild criticism about the State's record in fighting communal extremist organisations. In fact, the meeting had concluded that Kerala had taken effective measures to check communal and extremist forces and strengthen peace and religious amity.
Mr. Nayanar also cited the letter sent by the Director General (Investigations) of the National Human Rights Commission to all States urging them to follow the example set by Kerala with its effective police administration. The letter was also appreciative of the steps taken by the State Government to fight communal and extremist forces, to maintain law and order and protect human rights.
Mr. Rajagopal, he said, should have first got his facts correctly before making any statement. ``Rajagopal's statement is baseless and irresponsible. An RSS leader can make such a statement out of political spite, but it is inappropriate when such a statement comes from a Central Minister,'' he added. The Chief Minister claimed that no other State could equal Kerala's track record in ensuring communal amity, solidarity and peace.
