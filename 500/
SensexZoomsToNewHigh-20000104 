MUMBAI, JAN. 3. The Bombay Stock Exchange benchmark sensitive index (Sensex) zoomed sharply by over 369 points to scale an all- time peak at 5375 today in the wake of frenzied buying support by speculators and heavy purchases by foreign institutional investors. This was the second largest rise in the Sensex since March 24, 1992 when it had skyrocketed by 426.05 points. Starting on a strong footing on reports of a boom on Hong Kong and Singapore markets, shares rallied further sharply following the smooth rollover to the new millennium with all the critical sectors reporting no Y2K problems.
