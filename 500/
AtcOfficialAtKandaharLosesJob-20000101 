NEW DELHI, DEC. 31. An ATC official at the Kandahar airport, lost his job for giving information to the Indian pressperson on the hijacking over satellite phone.
``I know he has lost his job for giving indiscreet interviews to which the Taliban took strong exception to his activity as spokesman for the ATC,'' a top government official said here today.
``I do not know whether he has lost his life for this,'' he added. Khyber was answering almost all calls made over satellite phones from various media organisations round the clock.
