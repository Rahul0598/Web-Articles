HYDERABAD, JAN. 3. The Centre has asked all the State Governments to immediately trace and deport overstaying Pakistani nationals after the expiry of their visa. Addressing a press conference here on Monday, the Minister of State for Home, Mr. Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, said an estimated 11,000 Pakistani nationals were overstaying and 2,000 of them had gone underground. The instruction for deportation had been given in the wake of the hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight.
The Centre would soon publish a white paper soon on the subversive activities of Pakistan's Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) in the country. Among the Pakistani nationals who had `disappeared', 19 were in Andhra Pradesh and the 11 persons detained at Nizamabad on Sunday were Pakistani nationals. Commending the prompt action of the Nizamabad SP, he said the Centre had asked the A.P. Government to deport all the detenues.
Mr. Rao said the largest number of Pakistanis were in Uttar Pradesh followed by Rajasthan. It was for the State Governments to arrest and deport foreign nationals violating visa conditions. Though there was some ``dissatisfaction'' in some quarters, the world at large had appreciated India's handling of the hostage crisis.
The Minister said no application was pending with his Ministry seeking freedom fighters pensions except for seven in Bihar. He issued this clarification following numerous complaints by persons who participated in the Telangana armed struggle about the alleged delay by the Centre in approving pensions for them.
There was also a false notion that Andhra Pradesh had the largest number of pensioners. The highest were in Bihar (24,818), followed by West Bengal (22,441), U.P. (17,977) and Maharashtra (16,541). The number of pensioners in Andhra Pradesh was 11,253.
