NEW DELHI, DEC. 31. The former Enforcement Deputy Director, Mr. Ashok Agarwal, arrested on charges of extortion, bribery, forgery and causing wrongful confinement, was today remanded to 14 days judicial custody by a city court here. After facing custodial interrogation by the CBI officials for a week, Mr. Agarwal was produced in the court of judicial custody till January 13.
The CBI had sought Mr. Agarwal's police remand for five more days on the ground that some witnesses were to be confronted with his disclosure statement but the court rejected agency's plea saying ``custody is granted when it is indispensable.''
