CALCUTTA, JAN. 1. Hardliners in the West Bengal CPI(M) have once again succeeded in maintaining their stronghold over the party. They have forced the State committee to issue a showcause notice to the former MP, Mr. Saifuddin Chaudhury, and to reprimand two other leaders for allegedly breaching the party's discipline.
In their bid to put down dissension, the hardliners who wield considerable influence in the State committee, achieved their ends when Mr. Chaudhury was asked to show cause, the State Transport Minister, Mr. Subhas Chakraborty was publicly reprimanded and cautioned and the CPI(M) South 24- Parganas District Secretary, Mr. Samir Putatunda was pulled up for discussing party issues with the media, in violation of its rules and regulations.
