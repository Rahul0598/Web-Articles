AHMEDNAGAR, JAN. 4. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president, Mr. Sharad Pawar today supported the call given by the Prime Minister, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee to major powers in the world to declare Pakistan a ``terrorist state'' but said the nation ``has lost its prestige in the hijack episode''.
Mr. Pawar told PTI here that Mr. Vajpayee's statement at Pune yesterday in the context of hijacking of the Indian Airlines Airbus was ``quite appropriate''.
However, taking exception to the Vajpayee Government's release of three hardcore militants in exchange for safety and security of passengers, Mr. Pawar said ``whatever we gained in Kargil has been lost in the hijack drama''.
Meanwhile the NCP has decided to organise its own Seva Dal on the lines of the Congress Seva Dal and taken a first step in that direction by appointing some office-bearers in Maharashtra.
The NCP general secretary, Mr. Tariq Anwar, recently appointed Mr. Changezkhan Pathan as the president of the state Seva Dal, according to Mr. Vikas Karhade, who has been appointed its general secretary.
