ISLAMABAD, JAN. 4. India should learn a ``lesson'' from the hijacking of the Indian Airlines aircraft, ``Commander'' Naseer Ahmed Mujahid of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda outfit, claimed in a statement today.
The statement, faxed to the Islamabad office of The Hindu, said that the ``battle'' would continue in Kashmir, adding that ``bomb blasts in Srinagar'' were actions against the Indian Army.
It also demanded that Russia withdraw its Army from Chechnya or other embassies would also be attacked like the attack on the Russian embassy in Beirut. ``America, India and Russia are the enemies of Muslims. Mujahideen will continue their efforts against them,'' the statement added.
UNI reports:
The three militants may seek temporary refuge in Sudan, Nigeria or Saudi Arabia before ultimately returning to Kashmir, a Lahore daily reported.
The Nation, a sister publication of the Urdu daily Nawa-i-Waqt, quoted what it called ``a top secret report prepared by RAW'' in New Delhi.
It said the three militants - Maulana Masud Azhar, Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar and Ahmed Umar Syed - will ``cool off in one of these countries till the heat due to the hijack of the Indian Airlines flight 814 dies down''.
The paper said, ``Thereafter they will receive fresh training and indoctrination in an Afghan or Pakistani training camp before being sneaked into Jammu and Kashmir.''
