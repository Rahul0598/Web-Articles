SINGAPORE, JAN. 2. The raging sectarian strife in the eastern Indonesian Spice Islands has spread to the central sector too. At least 15 persons, including two security personnel, were killed in overnight communal violence in this new theatre of rioting, it was said in Jakarta today. The earlier phases of the current chain-reaction of Muslim-Christian sectarian violence were confined largely to the southern and northern parts of the isles.
A wide variety of weapons ranging from home-made bombs to guns and arrows were being recovered in a security sweep across the Spice isles.
Independent estimates placed the toll in the intermittent but fierce communal clashes in the isles at about 1200 during last year, with the first rioting in that traditionally peaceful region having occurred in January 1999. Even the official estimates account for about 1000 deaths, with nearly 325 killed in the last week alone in places extending from Ambon to Halmahera.
Last night's clashes in a new area, Masohi in Seram segment of Central Maluku mirrored the pattern seen earlier in the southern and northern parts, official accounts indicated.
On the political front, Gen. Wiranto, the Senior Minister for Politics and Security Affairs and the former TNI chief, said today that there was no need to involve foreign powers in the quest for a settlement of the latest crisis in the Spice isles. His comment acquired urgency in the context of calls by certain Christian community leaders of Ambon for the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force in Maluku at this time. Christians are in a majority in parts of the isles in predominantly Islamic Indonesia.
