CHENNAI, JAN. 2. The BJP general secretary, Mr. M. Venkaiah Naidu, today urged Pakistan to apprehend the hijackers and the released militants and hand them over to India.
Talking to reporters here, he said Pakistan, which had been ``exposed'' in the hijacking incident, should prove its innocence by arresting the hijackers and militants. ``All the hijackers had been identified as Pakistanis,'' he said.
Asked if the BJP wanted the Government to place this demand before Pakistan, he said the BJP, as a party, was making this demand. During negotiations, the hijackers had been receiving instructions from Pakistan. Both the hijackers and the militants had gone to Pakistan after the drama was over. The international community must come together to fight terrorism. Asked about Afghanistan's role, he said the response from Afghanistan was more than what was expected. However, India thought Afghanistan would try the militants under its law.
Pakistan's ISI was actively engaged in destabilisation and in aiding and abetting terrorism, he said. He denied there was any disgruntlement in the Union Cabinet about the release of the militants and that the Union Home Minister, Mr. L.K. Advani, had offered to resign.
Mr. Venkaiah Naidu criticised the opposition parties for blaming the government for releasing the militants. The Government had no other way, he said.
