PUNE, JAN. 3. Indian men's No. 2 Abhinn Shyam Gupta and National Games women's champion P.V.V. Laxmi won the singles titles at the V.V. Natu Memorial all-India badminton championships at the WIE complex today, beating a pair of junior National champions.
Gupta needed three games and 55 minutes to subdue Chetan Anand of Air India, 15-3, 4-15, 15-8, while Laxmi needed only 35 minutes to beat Parul Priyadarshini 11-4, 11-6.
Gupta has spend the past few months chasing the long shadow of P. Gopi Chand, finishing runner-up to the India No. 1 at the Asian Satellite in Hyderabad and the Syed Modi Memorial in Lucknow. Today, Gupta had to pull out all stops against the 20- year-old from Vijaywada who recovered from an error-ridden first game to storm back in the second.
It was a brave effort from the National junior champion who was in danger of being blanked out in the opener as he trailed 0-9, before getting a chance to serve and then slid back futher 0-13. He could pick up only 3 points in the game, forced into mistakes and frustrated by Gupta's defensive game.
Gupta was stunned by Anand's counterattack in the second game, in which the fifth-seed used a clever mix of jump smash, disguised drop and tight net game to throw Gupta off his length and even terms at 15-4. At one game each the momentum was with Anand but once again he made the fatal mistake of trying to cut rallies short and rushing his shots. Gupta showed splendid fighting spirit to shoot into a lead and hold onto it, all the way to a 15-8 finish.
Laxmi, two-time National champion is one of the country's most experienced players but following her three titles at the Imphal at the National Games went through a form slump which she said ended with her victory today. Against her 17-year- old opponent, whom she had beaten in the semifinals in Lucknow, Laxmi used the toss and drop combination to leave Parul stranded. The match was never close as the 25-year-old's net game and movement on court was always a step ahead of the young Railwaywoman.
Gupta won Rs. 15,000 as the men's winner and Laxmi Rs. 8000 as the women's singles winner. The runners-up took home Rs. 8000 in the men's event and Rs. 4000 in the women's event.
