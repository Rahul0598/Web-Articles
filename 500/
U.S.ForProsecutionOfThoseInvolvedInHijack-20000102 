WASHINGTON, JAN. 1. The Clinton administration not only said it is gratified that the hijacking has been resolved without further loss of life, but has also made it clear that all those party to ``the relevant international conventions on aircraft hijacking are obliged to prosecute or extradite those who committed this hijacking and the murder of Mr. (Rupin) Katyal... This should be our highest priority in the days ahead.'' This assurance came in the form of a statement from the Deputy Spokesperson of the State Department, Mr. James Foley.
``The release of the hostages is not the end of the matter. We will work with other Governments to see that those responsible are brought to justice...'' Mr. Foley said.
The State Department once again reiterated its condemnation of the ``horrific and inhuman act'' but went on to make the point that the United States was gratified that the hijacking came to a close without additional loss of life. ``Our sympathy goes out to the family of Mr. Katyal, the Indian national who was killed during the hijacking,'' the State Department has said.
The Clinton administration has also acknowledged the important role played by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross which provided ``valuable humanitarian support to alleviate the plight of the hostages during this ordeal''. The U.S., according to the State Department, was in close tough with the Government of India during this hijacking incident.
Impressed with Vajpayee
Saying it was impressed by the ``tireless efforts'' of the Indian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, the State Department said, ``We will continue to work with India and others to strengthen our cooperation to combat international terrorism. As the Prime Minister, Mr. A. B. Vajpayee, said in his address on New Year's Eve, the battle against terrorism can be won by all nations acting together.''
If the Clinton administration really means business, it will be addressing the issue of the hijackers being prosecuted or extradited in all seriousness. Media reports speak of the hijackers ``slipping'' into Pakistan. There has been one view that these people - including the released terrorists - would be finding their way back into Kashmir for fomenting more trouble.
The Taliban representative in New York, Mr. Abdul Hakeem, had made it clear in a conversation with The Hindu that at no time was there any agreement on the hijackers being allowed to stay on in Afghanistan or that they would face the local laws for the acts committed. Mr. Mujahid had made it known that the hijackers would have to ``get out'' of Afghanistan; there was no question of asylum.
That the hijackers' options were limited in terms of countries where they could go was obvious from the very beginning.
Diplomats and analysts point put that the BJP-led Government cannot get away from the post- mortem process which is going to be politically painful. In the first place, the monumental bungling of letting the hijacked plane leave Amristar has not gone unnoticed overseas.
