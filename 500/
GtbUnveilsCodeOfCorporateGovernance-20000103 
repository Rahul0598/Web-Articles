HYDERABAD, JAN. 2. The Hyderabad-based Global Trust Bank (GTB) unveiled its `code of corporate governance' here on Saturday, hoping that it would become a trendsetter for the banking industry.
The bank itself is in the process of implementing it in its totality, and if necessary, the composition of the board of directors would be reviewed and changed by March 2000, in accordance with this code, said Mr. Ramesh Gelli, Chairman and Managing Director.
Releasing the code of corporate governance at a press conference here, he said ``Enhancing long term shareholders value, protecting the interests of stakeholders, like depositors, employees is the fundamental object of the good corporate governance", he said.
The adoption of the code would bring the GTB closer to international best practices and elevate it to global standards, he felt.
The code was evolved by a working group (comprising outsiders) and adopted by the GTB's board at a meeting recently.
The code suggests broadbasing the board with at least 50 per cent consisting of `independent' directors, independent being defined as one who does not own substantial stock in the bank, and who does not have any material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the bank.
In this context, he said the bank would review its board's composition in March, and affect changes if necessary.The code also suggests that the board consist of executive chairman and executive director, with the CMD/ED normally having a tenure of not less than five year to ensure proper direction and continuity of policy.
It suggested forming of six committees - committee of board/credit committee, audit committee, nomination committee, compensation committee, risk review committee (assets and liabilities), and stakeholders relations committee.
Ensuring a high degree of transparency in communications to the shareholders is another suggestion.
