WASHINGTON, JAN 2. The Washington Times today apologised to the Sikh community for carrying an Associated Press despatch which misidentified two of the hijackers of the Indian Airlines aircraft as Sikhs.
``At the times,'' said the newspaper's Foreign Editor, Mr. David W Jones, ``we can easily argue that we were not strictly speaking wrong - that we accurately reported what the UAE brigadier (Brig Atiq Juma) said and that even if there was a Mistake, it was AP's, not ours. But the fact is that misleading information appeared on our front page.
``That is something that we should always find upsetting,'' Mr. Jones said.
``And so the Sikhs (who protested their misidentification in a letter to the paper) have struck a responsive chord with their complaint in their letter that we failed to find the facts patiently and professionally,'' he said.
