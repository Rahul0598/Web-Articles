NEW DELHI, JAN 3. The Bharatiya Janata Party has suggested that the Government set up special courts to speedily try militants and terrorists held in jails and give them exemplary punishment, including death sentences.
The Government must respond quickly to the challenge posed by terrorists as was brought out sharply during the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane, Mr J.P.Mathur, party vice- president and spokesperson, said here today.
None of the three terrorists released in exchange for the hostages had been tried or convicted although they were being held in jails for several years. Mohammad Masood Azar and Ahmed Umar Sayeed Sheikh had been in jail for almost six years while Mushtaq Zarger has been in detention under TADA since 1992.
Mr. Mathur said the ``problem'' had been further highlighted by the fact that the British Foreign Office has been quoted by the press as saying that Britain would allow Sheikh, a British national, to enter the country if he wished as he has not been tried for and convicted of any offence. It seemed that the Government had failed to file a ``challan'' ( a formal chargesheet) even against Zarger although police described him as the terror of Kashmir and charged him with masterminding many killings and conspiracies.
The hijackers had at first demanded the release of 36 terrorists and the end of the hijack should not ``allow us to forget that those supporting the terrorists may make further attempts to get the `others' released.''
