CHENNAI, JAN. 1. The TMC president, Mr. G. K. Moopanar, today said his party was planning a massive yatra from Kanyakumari to Chennai to highlight the lack of basic minimum needs in rural areas. This would be the new year venture of the party with thrust on people's participation in the districts, Mr. Moopanar said while flagging off the `secular' yatra of the Janata Dal(S) at the Kamaraj memorial in T. Nagar.
The TMC leader made specific reference to the simplicity with which the function was organised and said it was worthy of emulation by those organising public functions.
Mr. G. A. Vadivelu, president of the State unit of the Janata Dal(S) said the 10-day yatra, which would culminate at Kanyakumari on January 10, was organised to bring to the notice of both the Central and State Governments the shortfall with respect to protected water supply, housing and other basic amenities and also to demand social justice.
Mr. K. M. Khader Mohideen, State unit president of the IUML, Mr. R. Thirumavalavan, convenor of the Dalith Panthers of India, and Mr. Peter Alphonse, general secretary of the TMC, said the time had come for political parties to meet the people in rural areas to pinpoint problems faced by them.
