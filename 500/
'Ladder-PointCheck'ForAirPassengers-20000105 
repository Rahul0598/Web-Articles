CHENNAI, JAN. 4. As part of tightening of security measures at airports, following the recent hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar, a ``ladder-point check'' for screening the hand baggage of the air passengers has been introduced at all the major airports, including Chennai.
According to airport sources here, the security personnel of the respective airlines now conduct the ``ladder-point check'' at the tarmac area before the passengers board the flight. A thorough physical screening of hand luggage is carried out by airline security personnel under a makeshift table arrangement near the step-ladder.
The hand luggage of the Union Minister, Mr. T. R. Balu, and the CBI Director, Mr. R. K. Raghavan, who left on Monday by delayed Delhi-bound flights from here were subjected to detailed checks. The new step ladder check is made after the passengers pass through frisking by airport security personnel besides their checked-in luggage passing through X-ray screening machines.
The new measure has received mixed reaction from the travelling public who feel it is yet another method of harassment. A cross- section of the travellers point out there was nothing wrong in their hand baggage being examined as they do not want the Kandahar hijacking episode to be repeated. A similar check is being carried out by private air taxi operators also.
Bomb threat
An anonymous telephone call was received at the Madurai airport today stating that a militant with a bomb was on board an Indian Airlines flight (IC-671) departing from Mumbai and operating to Madurai via Chennai. The Madurai airport authorities conveyed the threat message to the Chennai and Mumbai counterparts to subject the aircraft to an extensive bomb detection check by bringing back the departed aircraft to the base. After detailed checks were carried out, the flight departed from Mumbai airport at 5 p.m.
