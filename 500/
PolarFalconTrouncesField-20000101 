NEW DELHI
DR. M.A.M. RAMASWAMY'S Polar Falcon, effortlessly ridden by Richard Hughes, made mincemeat of his ten rivals, including two stablemates, while winning the Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (Delhi) sponsored 2,000 Guineas, the last classic of the century here.
Trained by Gurdev Singh, the winner thus effaced the narrow defeat suffered in his maiden attempt here and pushed MAM's Classic tally to two short of three centuries.
A handy second upto 500m, the bay colt by Azaad out of Himafushi surged forward thereafter to tackle the event by a distance from Endless Quest (Amyn Merchant) who, in turn, was a length better than Classic Society (Rajinder). Fun And Fame placed fourth further three-fourth lengths behind in a field of six colts and five fillies.
Without being hastened at any stage, the winner clocked the distance of 1,400m in one minute and 24.5 secs.
Classic Society, though slow out, shaped like a runner up around 250m but was deprived of this spot by Endless Quest, winner of the 1,000 Guineas, in a driving finish. Dr. Ramaswamy's horses made a clean sweep of the top three slots to take the lion's share of the total stake money of Rs. 4,78,250.
In a card of eight events put up for the afternoon, jockey Rajinder, the local ace, liberally filled his bag with three winners.Dr. Ramaswamy had a word of praise about the standard of racing at Delhi when he said: ``racing here is quite competitive''.
