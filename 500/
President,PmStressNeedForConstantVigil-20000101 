NEW DELHI, DEC. 31. Within minutes after the hijack drama came to an end the President, Mr. K.R. Narayanan and the Prime Minister, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, said the incident has underscored the need for India to be ever alert to prevent such events from occurring in the future.
In a press release the President said the end of the hijack crisis was a welcome development as the nation celebrates the arrival of the new year leaving behind the unfortunate and traumatic incident.
``I congratulate the passengers for the fortitude they showed during the prolonged ordeal. We need to be ever alert to prevent such events from occurring in the future'', the President said.
In a special address to the nation the Prime Minister said the diabolic and evil act of hijacking is the latest manifestation of terrorism and ``we must not spare any effort, India shall not spare any effort to thwart the phenomenon of terrorism itself''.
Mr. Vajpayee said in dealing with the hijackers, the government was guided by two concerns: the safety of the passengers and the crew, and the long-term, overall interests of the country.
``For two decades now, this menace has exacted a cruel price from us in India. Thousands of innocent, defenceless men, women and children have been done to death.''
``Tens of thousands of families have lost their home and hearth. Surely, the time has come for the world to confront this evil, to act in concert and crush it. The battle against terrorism can be won'', the Prime Minister said.
Mr. Vajpayee said India shall join hands across nations to rid the world of the crime against humanity. He said the battle against terrorism can be won by all nations acting together and by outdoing the terrorist in patience, in technology, in strength and in intelligence.
