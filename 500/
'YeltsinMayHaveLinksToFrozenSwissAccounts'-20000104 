NEW YORK, JAN. 3. The former Russian President, Mr. Boris Yeltsin, may have links to at least a dozen frozen Swiss bank accounts that hold more than $ 15 millions, according to unidentified sources cited by Newsweek magazine.
The accounts, which Swiss authorities froze in mid- 1999, are not in Mr. Yeltsin's name but are held by offshore companies or by Russian and foreign individual businessmen, Newsweek reported in its January 10 issue.
But a burgeoning investigation into Russian money laundering charges through the Bank of New York resulted in accusations against Mr. Yeltsin months ago.
The Kremlin has denied that Mr. Yeltsin ever opened foreign bank accounts.
Mr. Yeltsin stunned the world by announcing on Friday that he was resigning with immediate effect and handing power over to Mr. Vladimir Putin, ending a turbulent nine-year reign since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
One of Mr. Putin's first acts was to grant Mr. Yeltsin and his family immunity against prosecution.
Mr. Yeltsin had decided on Dec. 24 to resign, less than one week after his party's success in the parliamentary elections, the magazine said. Apparently, he decided on Dec. 30 he would go out with the millennium.
Mr. Yeltsin's health has worsened significantly during the last few weeks, unidentified sources told the magazine. Mr. Yeltsin has insisted that health was not a factor in his decision to step down.
