NEW DELHI, DEC. 31. Hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane is understood to be a part of ``Operation Ramadan'' planned jointly by several militant outfits including Lashkar-e- Toiba (LET), Harkat-Ul-Mujahedeen (HUM) and Al-Badr under the supervision of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), official sources said today.
The LET, which reportedly launched the operation in early December, was joined by other outfits later and as part of their plans, they launched a series of attacks on army units and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir this month, on the State Chief Minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, on Wednesday and on the Special Operations Group Headquarters recently.
The sources, quoting reports from Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), said these groups also floated a ``Jehad-I-Kashmir fund,'' calling upon the Pakistanis to contribute on the eve of Id, for what they called ``waging Jehad in J and K.''
They also launched fund raising drives.
