JAMMU, JAN 1. The non- violent end of the seven-day old hijacking crisis at Kandahar, which was possible with the release of three top militant leaders, has not excited the commoners in the Kashmir Valley. While security authorities see it as a step backward, the Government justifies the agreement, and the separatists call it an ``offshoot of the unresolved Kashmir issue''.
Much against expectations, people in the Valley seem to be indifferent towards the peaceful end to the hijacking drama, perhaps preoccupied with fighting the chilly winter and the bloodbath in their own land. The release of the three top militants - Maulana Masood Azhar, Mushtaq Zargar and Ahmed Sheikh - has not prompted any reaction and the mood is subdued.
However, they did talk in terms of saving the innocent lives on board. ``What can be our reaction? We have been caught in a state of despair for the last ten years,'' said Mohammad Hanief, a businessman.
There is a section which sees the Kandahar episode as a ``surrender'' of the Indian Government to militants. Local newspapers today featured had headlines like: `India surrenders at Kandhar'.
Downtown Srinagar from where Mushtaq Zargar (one of the released militants), the chief of Al-Umar Mujahideen, hails, saw the bursting of crackers.
