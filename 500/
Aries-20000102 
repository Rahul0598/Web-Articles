Sun sign Aries (March 21 to April 20)
A fairly beneficial spell for professionals, students and traders. Realtors move at a gentle pace. New business lines move well. Don't gamble. A sudden trip may be necessary. Care and empathy will help clear a misunderstanding with an elderly relative. Romance may be mildly favourable. Financially no worries. Switching jobs may not be right now. Politicians must be cautious. Industrialists and contractors must meet commitments.
Moon in MESHA (Stars - Aswini, Bharani and Krittika first quarter)
Fine results for students, professionals, and commission traders. Politicians should manage. A sound budget at home and adherence to it even if the inflows are satisfactory. Income from speculation may be fairly reasonable. Shun romance completely. Realtors have to be patient, as plans may not bear early fruit.
Chandrashtma: From 2-37 p.m. on January 2 to 3-25 a.m. on the January 4/5.
