NEW DELHI, JAN. 1. ``After stabbing Rupin (Katyal), the hijackers tried to save him, but in vain,'' says Mr. Sanjiv Sharma, one of the over 150 passengers released by the hijackers yesterday after an eight-day-long captivity.
Rupin was the lone casualty in the hijacking episode, the longest hijack crisis involving an Indian aircraft. Talking to UNI, a relieved Mr. Sharma said after Rupin was brutally stabbed, the hijackers asked a lady doctor on the plane to treat him.
``Seeing a lot of blood gushing out, the hijackers asked a doctor among the passengers, a lady doctor from Nainital, to treat Rupin. However, when the whole exercise went in vain, they threw the dead body out.''
Asked why the hijackers singled out Rupin, Mr. Sharma said he did not have any definite answer to this.``I don't exactly know what led to the drastic action against Rupin.''
He said the hijackers also slapped a few people, if they did not find them obeying.
Asked about his physical condition and the impact the whole episode had on him, Mr. Sharma said, ``though I am feeling fine, I think it still has to sink in.
``I am happy that all the hostages, except the unfortunate Rupin, survived the ordeal.''
