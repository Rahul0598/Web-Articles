NEW DELHI, JAN. 2. The Election Commission (EC) will meet officials of the Union Home Ministry on January 5 to review the law and order situation in the four States where Assembly elections are due in the next few weeks.
The EC is also expected to decide on the time-frame for Assembly elections in the four States - Bihar, Orissa, Haryana and Manipur - and by-elections in 11 States. The by-election schedule includes the Bellary Lok Sabha constituency in Karnataka vacated by the Congress(I) president, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, and the Kannauj constituency in Uttar Pradesh vacated by the Samajwadi Party president, Mr. Mulayum Singh Yadav.
The EC had recently sent one of its senior officials for an on- the-spot assessment of the situation in Bihar and Orissa which was hit by the super-cyclone.
While the term of the Bihar Assembly is to expire in March, the term of Assemblies in Orissa and Manipur is to expire in April.
Election to the Haryana State Assembly has been necessitated following the decision of the Om Prakash Chautala Government to dissolve the Assembly 17 months ahead of its date of expiry.
The EC is keen on completing the election process in the four States in February itself. This would enable the new Assemblies to meet in March and to either obtain a vote-on- account or go for a full-fledged budget.
The EC is conscious of the fact that holding elections in March is not feasible as it is examination season. The EC cannot requisition the services of school teachers for conduct of elections. Moreover, majority of the polling booths are located in school buildings.
The EC will also keep in mind the fact that the budget session of Parliament will begin in the fourth week of February and leaders of major political parties would like the Assembly elections to be completed before the session.
