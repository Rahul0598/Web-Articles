IMPHAL, JAN.4. The Prime Minister, Mr. A. B. Vajpayee, and the Union Home Minister, Mr. L. K. Advani, reviewed the law and order situation in Manipur with the State Chief Minister, Mr. Wahengbam Nipamacha, and the Chief Secretary, Mr. H. Jelshyam, recently. They also reportedly discussed the controversial release on parole, of the Kanglei Yawal Kunna Lup (KYKL-O) leader, N. Oken. Oken, who was detained under the National Security Act (NSA), was released in December.
The move to release Oken had raised a controversy. The decision was taken by the Chief Secretary without the Chief Minister's knowlege
Meanwhile, Oken had sent a letter to the Chief Secretary requesting three months' extension of his parole. He had enclosed a medical certificate from a Chennai hospital. Officials felt, more insurgents might apply for parole, if Oken was granted an extension.
According to the Manipur Government, the law and order in the State took an ugly turn, following the withdrawal of Army for deployment at Kargil.
The State Government also sought additional central forces to deal with the situation. The Centre had already sent BSF and CRPF battalions to the State.
Meanwhile, the Centre was also considering the Opposition demand that President's rule be imposed in the State ahead of the Assembly elections in March.
