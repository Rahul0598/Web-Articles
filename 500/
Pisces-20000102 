Sun sign Pisces (Feb. 19 to March 20)
Past hard work starts yielding good results to those in politics, fine arts, professions, career women and students. Cheer will be promoted by participation in auspicious functions. Though there may be runaway expenditure, finances will not be unmanageable. Avoid speculating heavily. Some of you may have on a journey covering several holy places. The romantically-minded may see fortune smile shyly at them. While friends and relatives may be reliable and dependable, colleagues a work cannot be trusted at all.
Moon in MEENA (Stars - the last quarter of Poorvabhadrapada, Uttarabhadrapada, and Revathi)
Politicians find winds favourable for implementing dormant proposals. Writers and freelancers will be honoured. Twin benefits for government servants - promotion and transfer. A useful journey away from home due. Celebrations and joyous functions likely in some homes. Servants will defy instructions. If ordering them about is stopped, there should be better response. Maintain polite relations with associates in business so that they give their best possible support.
Chandrashtma: Continuing from last week up to 2-37 p.m. on January 2.
