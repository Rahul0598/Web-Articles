MUMBAI, JAN. 4. Life in the city was affected for the second day today due to the transporters' strike, in protest against actions adopted against polluting vehicles even as the Maharashtra Government threatened to invoke the provisions of the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA).
Thousands of passengers arriving in the city were put to hardships with 2.5 lakh transporters, including over 55,000 taxis and one lakh rickshaws, going off the roads.
Addressing the agitating transporters outside the Transport Commissioner's Office at Bandra, leaders of the `Mumbai mal Vahatuk ani Pravasi Vahatuk Malak-Chalak Kriti Samiti', which has called the strike, said the strike would continue `indefinitely' unless the Government finds an amicable solution.
Meanwhile, the State Transport Minister, Mr. Shivajirao Moghe, told reporters at the Mantralaya that `the Government was open for talks with the agitating transporters'.
The State Government would use provisions of the ESMA to take stringent measures against those obstructing the transportation of essential commodities, the Minister said.
The transporters' strike had not affected the supply of essential commodities, Mr. Moghe said.
He said 570 truck loads of vegetables and 74 trucks carrying fruits arrived in Mumbai today.
The transporters are agitating against the Government's decision to implement the Mumbai High Court directive ensuring that all vehicles entering the city comply with emission norms.
