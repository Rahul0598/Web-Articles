CHENNAI, JAN. 1. The DMK has tightened the entry norms for aspiring candidates for the ensuing party organisational elections at various levels by directing them to give up one of the official posts they might hold in government bodies or cooperatives well before filing nominations for the party posts.
Nomination papers for the posts of secretaries and deputy secretaries in the elections to the DMK's city, town, district, panchayat union and ward-level units will not be accepted by the party headquarters if the aspirants did not resign from at least one of the official posts they may be holding.
The DMK's general secretary, Mr.K.Anbazhagan, in a statement here said that this ``important decision''`` had been taken in pursuance of the party's recent general council meeting authorising the DMK President, Mr.M.Karunanidhi, and himself to take certain decisions on organisational matters on the basis of the consensus reached at that meeting.
