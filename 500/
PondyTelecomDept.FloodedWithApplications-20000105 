Twelve counters were opened in the school premises to receive applications and DDs from prospective subscribers. More than 30 staff of the department were deployed to manage the counters and allied works. The moment the reduced registration fee was announced people of different strata of society thronged the Telecommunications office in Rangapillai Street. Submission of forms began on Monday and police were deployed to regulate the queue.
Pondicherry has, in recent years, made good progress in the communication sector. The introduction of sophisticated communication systems as done in metropolitan centres has helped economic and trading activities, besides tourism.
