AMRITSAR, JAN. 3. The Raja Sansi airport here did not have a ladder required for refuelling Airbuses and this could have been the reason why it took so long to send a bowser to refuel the hijacked Indian Airlines aircraft on December 24.
Indian Airlines and airport officials here said that on December 24, night, if they had been given orders from New Delhi to refuel the Airbus, it would have taken at least 15 to 20 minutes to assemble a ladder.
After that the refuelling would have taken another 40 minutes, thereby prolonging the stay of the hijacked plane here by over an hour or even more.
Earlier, the airport had a ladder for refuelling Airbuses but it was taken to some other airport when the airlines stopped using an Airbus for the New Delhi Amritsar-Srinagar sector.
Regarding the mysterious ``Mr. B. Lal, who called the Air Traffic Control at Raja Sansi to know whether the hijacked plane had landed, officials said that two calls were received from Mr. Lal who identified himself as an official from the Union Home Ministry.
However, Mr. Lal only made inquiries whether the plane was being refuelled but at no point did he suggest or give orders for refuelling the Airbus, officials claimed.
To fly again from Jan. 8
The hijacked plane was expected to be put back into service by January 8 after undergoing the necessary checks, refurbishing the interior and an engine change.
