NEW DELHI, JAN. 3. In a taste of things to come, the Government today came under fire from the Congress(I), the Nationalist Congress Party and the Janata Dal (Secular) for its handling of the hijacking crisis. The Opposition came down heavily on the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh, for personally ``escorting'' to Kandahar the three dreaded terrorists exchanged for the release of the hostages.
India had become a ``weak, faltering and hesitant'' state under this Government, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, senior Congress(I) leader, said. The party demanded a ``credible'' explanation on why the plane was not stopped in Amritsar; why it was necessary for Mr. Jawant Singh to go to Kandahar when the negotiations were over and when India does not recognise the Taliban regime; and why the Prime Minister was not informed of the hijacking for a full 40 minutes.
Severely criticising Mr. Singh's action, Congress(I) spokesman, Mr. Ajit Jogi, said the Government had accorded respectability to terrorism and had ``bent backwards'' to appease the hijackers - a totally uncalled-for step. ``This once again demonstrates the weakness and immaturity of the Government,'' Mr. Jogi observed.
The Congress(I) said that the proof of the impetus that terrorists and their activities had received was immediately apparent in Srinagar when a bomb blast this morning killed 13 persons.
The Nationalist Congress Party demanded a `White Paper' on the issue. Nuclear status per se did not increase the power of a country to protect its national interests unless there was a cohesive, institutional mechanism to plan and execute important decisions.
According to the NCP spokesman, Mr. Devendra Dwivedi, the episode raised serious questions about the Government's crisis management abilities. The delay in informing the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister's personal handing over of the terrorists had serious implications. Describing the handling as ``ham-handed'', he suggested the setting up of a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to examine crisis management preparedness.
The former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) president, Mr. H. D. Deve Gowda, has demanded a high-level, independent inquiry to uncover all the facts and fix responsibility. In a statement, Mr. Gowda termed the decision of Mr. Jaswant Singh to accompany the three terrorists as ``most disgusting humiliating''.
``What made the Prime Minister take such a decision when he himself had earlier rejected the advice of Ms. Mamata Banerjee to lead a political delegation to Kandahar? This kind of dignified passage to known terrorists is a rare phenomenon which really brought down the honour and the reputation of the nation in the eyes of the international community. I am wondering why a farewell party was not arranged in honour of the terrorists before handing them over to Taliban authorities'', he asked.
Mr. Gowda said the handling of the crisis clearly established lack of coordination in the Government. It had lost a very good opportunity when the plane was in Amritsar and the demand of the hijackers was limited to the release of a single terrorist.
Criticising the Prime Minister's stand that the crisis had been resolved keeping in mind the long-term interests of the nation, Mr. Gowda wondered why Government could not arrive at the same compromise in the very beginning.
He said there was no rationale in delaying the despatch of the Indian team to Kandahar. It was astonishing that the Home, Defence and Civil Aviation Ministers were kept away from the decision-making.
