PUNE, JAN. 2. It was a day of the junior champions in the V. V. Natu memorial all-India badminton championship being held at in the WIE Complex here. Chetan Anand and Parul Priyadarshini, who won the junior National titles in Kohima two months ago, pulled off upsets to record their biggest victories among the seniors.
Chetan, a 19-year-old from Vijayawada and employed in Air India, saved one match-point before outlasting India No. 3 Nikhil Kanetkar in a semifinal which lasted 75 minutes. Nikhil squandered an attempt to finish the match at 16-16 in the second game as his smash went out. Chetan went on to win the game 17-16 on his fourth game-point, and came back from 1-5 down in the third to edge out Nikhil.
The No. 2 seed Nikhil, who was suffering from a cold, quit midway through the final game due to fatigue, giving Chetan a deserving 10-15, 17-16, 8-5 win. In the final Chetan will meet top seed Abhinn Shyam Gupta, who wore down the No. 3 seed Siddharth Jain in a pallid semifinal at 15-8, 15-7.
The women's final will feature the unseeded 17-year- old Parul Priyadarshini and Hyderabad Asian Satellite finalist P. V. V. Laxmi. Parul pulled off back-to-back upsets today, beating No. 3 C. H. Deepti of Andhra Pradesh 11-9, 6-11, 11-4 in the quarterfinals, and then toppling No. 1 seed B. R. Meenakshi in a 25-minute semifinal 11-2, 11-3.
Parul, a pint-sized teenager from Dehradun, has been hired by the Railways and trains with Sanjay Sharma in Mumbai. She showed great speed and cunning to beat the India No. 2.
In the other semifinal, Laxmi beat the No. 2 seed Trupti Murgunde, a semifinalist at the Hyderabad Asian Satellite and second seed here, in a 40-minute semifinal 7-11, 11-3, 11-5. Parul and Laxmi met in the semifinals of the Asian Satellite where Laxmi emerged on top, but the former senior National champ would do well to be wary tomorrow as Parul is enjoying a very good run here.
Not a selection event
The knowledge that the Badminton Association of India (BAI) had stripped the Natu Memorial of its status as a `selection event' for the Thomas and Uber Cup teams, came as a big disappointment to the players. The decision was taken because the organisers were forced to reduce the prize- money from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. one lakh, and at that time, the players were already on their way to Pune to discover that the tournament would only offer National rankings points but not count in selection. ``It is not the players' fault. After all, the leading players barring Aparna, Gopi and Sachin Ratti are here. It is not that the field is a weak one. These results should count in selection. There should not be a connection between prize-money and a selection event, specially since all the players are here,'' said one unhappy competitor.
The organisers lost out on live television coverage and sponsorship as Doordarshan declared that the `millennium celebration' coverage left no room even on DD Sports for this event.
