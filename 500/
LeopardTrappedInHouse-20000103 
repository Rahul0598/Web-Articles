NEW DELHI, JAN. 2. A leopard walked into an aged couple's house in Faridabad early this morning, creating panic among residents. It made itself comfortable in a bathtub for almost seven hours, before it was captured by experts from the Delhi Zoo.
The seven-member team, led by the Zoo director, Mr. B.R.Sharma, trapped the animal after a two-hour operation.
Experts believe that the leopard could have jumped on a moving truck last night from the nearby ridge area and reached Faridabad where it was looking for a safe place to hide. The five-year-old male leopard, weighing about 100 kg, will be treated at the Zoo Hospital before it is formally made a member of the wildlife here.
The drama began unfolding at the residence of retired IPS officer Mr. Prem Mehra, when he along with his wife, Mrs. Pampa Mehra, came out of their house on hearing a commotion. The couple saw the feline quietly walk into their drawing room.
The police and civic authorities were informed. But by that time the animal entered Mr. Mehra's house and hid itself in the bathroom. Mr. Mehra managed to shut the door of the lounge, so that the leopard could not come out.
On information, zoo officials rushed to the spot. After thorough checking, the officials, armed with a tranquilliser gun and a lathi, bolted the rooms to restrict the movement of the leopard. When it was ensured that the animal was in the bathroom, they placed a cage in front of the bathroom door so that in case the leopard made an attempt to escape, it would be trapped.
The officials injected one tranquillser shot from the ventilator which hit the target. The next two shots made the leopard violent. The animal damaged the sanitary fittings inside the bathroom. It was in the next seven minutes that the leopard became immobile and walked into the trap. They immediately shut the trap and carted it away to the truck parked outside.
