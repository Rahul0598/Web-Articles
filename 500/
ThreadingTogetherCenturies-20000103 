THERE seems to be a sudden spate of fashion shows. And what other finale would be fitting for an exhibition specially got up for women.
The Woman, an exhibition of the latest domestic technology and cosmetic new-finds at the Rajah Muthiah Hall culminated in a fashion show by Seams Natural, Sastri Nagar. "Centuries Threaded Together" as the show was titled, paraded some of the exotic fabrics and weaves of the country. Innovative to the T, the Indo- western outfits smacked of ethnicity in fabric and workmanship, while the cuts and styling were contemporary. The collection of saris stood out for their traditional appeal. The show was co- ordinated by Xtraortinaire.
