Be careful with finances, as you may face heavy expenditure. Avoid romance, new businesses and speculation. At the workplace, the going may be unexciting. Keep your confidence secure. Do not permit laxity by subordinates or servants. A smiling face and plenty of sympathy will go a long way in dealing with older children. A legal snarl may come as a nasty surprise for some. Mixed prospects are here for politicians. Industrialists will need to pull-up some workers for going slow.
