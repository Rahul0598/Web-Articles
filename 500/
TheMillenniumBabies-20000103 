CHENNAI, JAN. 2. The arrival of a baby is definitely a joyous occasion, but when two babies were born in the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (IOG), Egmore, last night, there was more than the usual reasons for celebration.
The babies, one male and the other female, came into the world kicking, at the stroke of midnight of the new year. By the same stroke, they also shot into fame as `the millennium babies'.
Consequently, the mothers too became `millennium mothers' and froze under the unfamiliar glare of camera lights. Both the mothers, Ms. Amirtham and Ms. Usha, cannot fully comprehend what all the noise and hype is about.
``We had no plans for this. It just happened,'', they say and admit that they are too bewildered to chalk out any future plans.
``My husband is a coolie - a daily wage labourer. We are mostly wondering where the next meal will come from, so it is difficult to dream for the child,'' says Ms. Usha, the mother of the female baby.
However, the city's interest in their children has also got them thinking, ``perhaps, there is something more than special about the children.''There are, of course, other babies who missed the bulls-eye by just minutes. While at the Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women, Triplicane, a 2.6 kg female baby was born to Ms. Jothylakshmi and Mr. Dhanasekhar at 12-01 a.m., a healthy male baby weighing 3.3 kgs, was born in the IOG at 12-05 a.m.
At a private hospital on AVM Avenue in Virgambakkam, a male child was born through normal delivery at 12-18 a.m. to Mrs Vennila Parandaman.
