HER simple face belies her vast exposure in the international arena of theatre and dance. Though brought up in Paris, Shanthala Shivalingappa has profound passion for Kuchipudi.
Shanthala has worked with Maurice Bejart as a soloist for a ballet commemorating the bi-centenary of the French revolution. She has also acted in Shakespeare's "The Tempest" directed by Peter Brook. A solo performance in Zingaro's "Chimere", participation in Pina Bausch's dance show recently and Kuchipudi recitals at prestigious festivals the world over have won for Shanthala a special place in the dance firmament.
Kuchipudi dance is the ultimate experience for her. "The immense joy compares with nothing else," says the young dancer, who is to perform in the city on January 7, at 6-30 p.m. at the Rukmini Devi Cultural Centre, West Mambalam.
