CHENNAI, JAN. 2. For the seventeen Indians who figured in the qualifying draw competitions the dream of making it to the main event, the Gold Flake Open ended on Sunday.
Two rounds of matches in the 32-player draw, ended with none of them there for the last eight matches slated for tomorrow morning.
The outcome was not entirely surprising for the Indians are way back in the ranking and it would have needed a Paes-like resolve and temperament to surmount odds and spring surprises.
Many felt Prahlad Srinath, who has been a member of the Indian Davis Cup squad, was unlucky not to receive a wild card to the main draw had that.
His mood was reflected when he swept aside countrymate Saurav Panja, fresh from his recent win in the Krishnan Tennis Centre tournament.
But thereafter Srinath was unlucky to confront the second seeded Briton Jamie Delgado, who is ranked 162 in the ATP list.
Still Srinath never put any stops to his natural flair on the backhand. His baseline game also was steady but that was not enough.
Nitin Kirtane was the next who appeared on course but from a 5-4 first set situation, he not only lost his way but his game fell apart inexplicably against the fifth seeded Japanese Yaoki Ishii in the second round.
The only seeded player to fall at this stage was Arvind Parmar (GBR), who went down to Israel's Andy Ram.
