NEW DELHI, DEC. 31. The Union Government has decided to send at least two sky marshals in 40 international and domestic flights in view of the lax security at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan airport, which resulted in the hijacking of Indian Airlines plane.
A Civil Aviation official said ``the plan had been operationalised from yesterday'' with the marshals drawn from the National Security Guards accompanying two flights to Srinagar and Imphal.
The decision was taken by the Cabinet three or four days ago and the plan was chalked out in consultation with the NSG on December 27 and 28.
The marshals would be armed with lethal yet small arms to tackle any possible hijack attempt.
