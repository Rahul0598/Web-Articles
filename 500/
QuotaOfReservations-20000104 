Sir, - As you remarked in the Editorial (TheHindu, Dec. 24), the Supreme Court in its judgment on October 1, 1996 ruled ``that the quota regime at the stage of departmental promotions is violative of the Constitution''.
Reservation is quite essential at the entry stage. If it is extended to the promotion level also, quality will suffer. Already, the country is turning out mediocrities and a deep dent has been made in the body-politic. There has been a rapid exodus by intellectuals for want of proper encouragement and recognition.
Politicians should, instead of having an eye on the next general election, do some introspection in the interest of the next generation.
When all is said and done, the beneficiaries should also rise to the occasion and live up to the adage, `liberty means responsibility' and see that it is not abused.

Sir, - You have rightly said a serious debate on the issues raised by the Supreme Court verdict should have been allowed to let an opinion crystallise on the quota regime.
Direct recruitment of SC/ST is not confined to Groups C and D. It is provided for in all-India services and at several levels of administration. It is done even at the level of district judges. These provisions ensure qualitative and quantitative representation to SC and ST.
The Constituent Assembly debates never referred to reservation in promotion and the apex court has held that it is violative of the Constitution. It amounts to double reservation and adversely affects others, and is not provided for even in Tamil Nadu. What then is the necessity to go for a Constitution amendment for this?
