CHENNAI, JAN. 2. Speculation is rife in political circles that the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), an ally of the ruling DMK, is cut up over the latter's invitation extended to Mr.Dheeran, leader of the Tamil Pattali Makkal Kazhagam (TPMK), to attend the unveiling function of the Thiruvalluvar statue held at Kanyakumari on Saturday.
The absence of the PMK founder, Dr.S.Ramadoss, at the function is attributed to this factor, though his name figured prominently in the official invitation and media advertisements released by the Tamil Nadu Government.
Mr.Dheeran, who was the president of the PMK since its formation in 1989, broke away from the party prior to the 1998 Lok Sabha election and turned a bitter rival to Dr. Ramadoss.
Relationship between the DMK and PMK is said to be already under strain after the Government ordered a CB-CID inquiry into the recent attack on the Vanniyar Sangham president, Mr.A.K.Natarajan, at his T.Nagar residence.
Mr.Natarajan had alleged that the attack was instigated by Dr.Ramadoss. Rejecting the charge as baseless at a press conference last week, the PMK founder termed the incident as a `deliberate conspiracy' hatched by `certain vested interests' to mar his image.
