SYDNEY, JAN. 4. His voice was emotional and eyes moist. ``I would like to dedicate this hundred to my uncle Baba Krishna Mohan, my parents, my brother, my coaches and all my well-wishers for encouraging me in my bad times.`` V.V.S. Laxman was being the humble person that he is.
Skipper Sachin Tendulkar was lavish in his praise. ''I loved the way he batted today. He showed the rest of the team what happens when you spend some time in the middle.``
Kapil Dev patted Laxman. ''It was outstanding. I have no words to describe his knock. In this time of disarray, to bat so positively and impressively was great.``
''He showed it is not the power but timing which is so important to the art of batting,`` said Kapil. The Indian coach added, ``it was one of the best innings I have seen from an Indian batsman.''
Laxman said he was feeling low after the Melbourne Test. ''I really thought I let the team down there by playing rash strokes. Here, my captain advised me to just hang around and spend some more time at the wicket. I thought I played well in the first innings here.''
The elegant opener said he was grateful to Kapil and Tendukar. ``I thank them for giving me the opportunity to play in this Test. They have encouraged me a lot.''
Did he expect to stay on? Laxman smiled, ``It is up to the selectors. If it happens, I will really be glad.''
Laxman also revealed the reason for his aggression against Brett Lee. ``I just wanted to play positively. The relationship with Lee goes back to my under-19 days. He toured India with the Australia youth team. Then I was the highest run- getter for India and he was the highest wicket-taker for the Australian team. It is always a great challenge facing him and I think throughout this tour, he has got me out three-four times.''
No wonder Lee applauded him the most. And the Australian team, too. Forming a circle and clapping till Laxman disappeared into the dressing room.
