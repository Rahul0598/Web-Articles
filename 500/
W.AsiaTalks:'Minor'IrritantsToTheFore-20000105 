MANAMA (Bahrain) JAN. 4 While media attention has focussed on the major issues to be discussed by Syria and Israel in the talks which commenced in Shepherdstown (West Virginia, U.S.) yesterday, some relatively ``minor'' issues have come to light. Issues such as the plight of Syrians in Israeli jails, the future of liberation fighters based in Damascus and the fallout of a Syrian-Israeli settlement on other regional States have been relatively overlooked till now. But the resolution of these problems could be just as important in the search for a permanent settlement between these two States.
In the Shepherdstown talks, conducted principally between the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Ehud Barak and the Syrian Foreign Minister Mr. Farooq al Sharaa with strong contributions from the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton and his Secretary of State, Ms. Madeleine Albright, the focus is on four major aspects. Separate joint committees are discussing the questions of the border to be fixed between Israel and Syria, the security guarantees by both sides, the degree and pace of normalisation between them and water distribution from the Golan Heights watershed. Before the talks got underway there was some hope that the two sides would, at least, be able to finalise a ``Declaration of Principles'' to cover some or all of these issues. But the word from Shepherdstown is that hopes should not be raised too high since the two sides have just begun the excruciating task of taking up the details.
Even the U.S. administration, which appears desperate to wind up the different strands of the West Asian negotiations before Mr. Clinton's term in office ends, is just saying that they believe there is a historic opportunity for a breakthrough on the Syria- Israel track. They have also, however, cautioned that this breakthrough may not occur in the current round of talks even though they could last for anything up to ten days. There is already talk of another round in February.
In the region meanwhile, issues which are not prominent in the Shepherdstown talks are being raked up. Syrian students have demanded the release of their countrymen jailed by Israel. The question of their continuance in custody cuts to the heart of the dispute between the two sides. To the Israelis, many of the imprisoned Syrians are terrorists, while for their own countrymen they are people fighting a legitimate war of liberation against foreign occupation. It is inconceivable that Syria will allow its nationals to languish in Israeli jails after the conclusion of a final settlement. Yet, the Israeli Government will also be under pressure from those who are against the release of prisoners with ``Jewish blood on their hands''.
Israel is likely to demand that Damascus close down organisations like the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which have rejected the Oslo processes and are based in Syria. The cynical view is that the Syrian Government treats these Palestinian organisations as mere chips in the bargaining with Israel but there is an ideological and historical affinity between the Syrian leadership and the DFLP/PFLP. Damascus is unlikely to hand over the leaders and members of these organisations to Israel.
An attractive alternative is a deal whereby the members and leaders of the DFLP/PFLP are allowed to return to the Palestinian territories. The DFLP leader, Mr. Nayef Hawatmeh has already been given permission to enter the Gaza Strip. But if the members of these organisations, which Israel accuses of being actively involved in terrorism, are allowed to settle in territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority then Israel cannot argue against the resettlement on these same territories of Palestinian refugees who may not be involved in any political activity. Israel's stand is that they will not agree to allow Palestinian refugees to return even to the PA controlled territory.
If a final settlement is achieved, whatever its shape, Syria should come to re-posses most of the Golan Heights.
