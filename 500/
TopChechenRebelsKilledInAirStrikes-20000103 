MOSCOW, JAN. 2. At least 300 rebels have been killed in Russian air strikes overnight on targets in southern Chechnya as fierce fighting continued in the breakaway republic's capital Grozny, Radio Echo Moskvy reported today.
Seven field commanders, including 24-year-old dreaded warlord Arbi Barayev, were also killed in the fresh attacks on one of the mountain villages in Serzhen-Yurt region, military sources were quoted by NTV channel saying.
Amid fighting to gain control over besieged Grozny, the rebels, posing stiff resistance to federal troops, blasted two reservoirs filled with ammonia and chlorine today, NTV said.
The television said poisonous clouds were looming over rebel positions in Grozny, bringing lives of thousands of civilians still sheltering in basements of ruined buildings, under risk.
Meanwhile, buoyed by the acting President, Mr. Vladimir Putin's visit to Gudermes in Chechnya, pro-Moscow Chechen workers were working round-the-clock building a new government building.
``After Putin's visit, Chechens and residents of Gudermes have no doubt in the Russian Government's ernest intentions to uproot all bandits in Chechnya,'' Itar-Tass quoted the local administration head, Mr. Malika Gezimiyeva, as saying.
A report from Washington, quoting the pentagon, said Russia had used tactical Scud missiles in its offensive in Chechnya.
``We can confirm that,'' a Defense Department official told AFP yesterday but refused to provide any details.
The launching of three Scud missiles against targets in Chechnya was detected on Friday by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which relayed the information to the Centre for Year 2000 Strategic Stability, where the U.S. and Russian officers monitor missile launches.
