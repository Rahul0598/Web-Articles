NEW DELHI, JAN. 1. Explosives found in the cargo hold of the hijacked plane were removed by the Taliban authorities at around 11 p.m. last night. The plane was thoroughly searched and sealed. It was subsequently refuelled and brought back here today at around 12.30 p.m. by Captain J.R.D. Rao, Managing-Director of Alliance Air. The delay was partially due to the fog conditions here.
The 217-seater aircraft had a crew comprising the Pilot, Co- Pilot, Flight Engineer, 5 to 6 engineers and an operational crew. There were no passengers.
The plane which went through long hours of flying from Kathmandu to Amritsar to Dubai to Lahore and finally to Kandahar required intense maintenance checks. Its Auxiliary Power Unit for air conditioning had to be set right as it had run for more than 100 hours. Normally an aircraft undergoes routine maintenance checks every day.
Poor visibility over the IGI airport gave some anxious moments yesterday as the Boeing 737-200 aircraft which carried the first batch of hostages, is not certified to land in dense fog conditions. Besides there was the Y2K bug that had to be beaten before the Contingency Plan was activated at 9.30 pm.
The second batch of hijacked passengers were flown in the relief aircraft, Airbus-320. Technically there was a strong sense of urgency to fly out all the three aircraft out of Kandahar before the Y2K Contingency Plan and the fog set in. However, only the Boeing and the relief planes landed before the stipulated time. The hijacked plane was not moved out for it had to undergo some checks and repairs.
