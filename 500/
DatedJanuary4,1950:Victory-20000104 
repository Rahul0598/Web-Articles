India had won the Third Test Match against the Commonwealth Eleven, at Calcutta! The Hindu said that it was a personal triumph for the Captain.
Excerpts from the Editorial: ``Hazare's flawless and masterly batting secured him a grand century, the second in this season's series. In making the top-score of the match, Hazare proved that the burden of leadership sits lightly on him. If ever Vijay Merchant (who was unfortunately kept away by an injury to his palm) is to step down, Vijay Hazare has shown that he can step into his position. Credit must go to our great-hearted trio of bowlers, Phadkar, Chowdhury and C. S. Nayudu, for getting the Commonwealth side out twice in two days - for moderate totals. For once, the visitors had a taste of their own medicine; they took over India's role of fighting defensively with her back to the wall.
``The Indian attack was supported by tight fielding in the Commonwealth's first innings, which ended for a comparatively meagre score. But, forced to follow on, the visitors fought back with determination and vigour and, aided by one or two lapses which have become the rule with our fieldsmen, put up a respectable score.
``Our Special Correspondent, George Duckworth, says that India hit off the runs required, thanks chiefly to Mustaq Ali and Hazare. Thus had ended a memorable match, full of fluctuations... Indians have had it brought home to them in match after match that missed catches may well mean defeat. Our players and those in charge of the game must attend to this without delay. So, on to Kanpur, with the scores even may the better side win and may both play the game.''
