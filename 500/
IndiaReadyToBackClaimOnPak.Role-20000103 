NEW DELHI, JAN. 2. India is getting ready to present both direct and circumstantial evidence to back its claims on Pakistan's involvement in the hijacking of Flight IC-814, according to well- placed sources in the Government.
India is in the process of assessing the valuable information and leads gained during the hostage crisis. The Government is expected to release some of this information - sooner than later - to prove the assertion on Pakistan's complicity by the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Jaswant Singh, on Saturday.
If the Government can indeed demonstrate that the footprints on the Christmas-eve hijacking of the Indian passenger aircraft are Pakistan's, it can salvage something from the hostage crisis and gain worldwide support for its war against terrorism.
If India does not quickly and credibly justify its allegation against Pakistan, Mr. Singh's statements will be dismissed by the international community as typical, knee-jerk reactions from India. The world is tired of the usual trading of charges between New Delhi and Islamabad. There has been considerable negative reaction to the incredulous attempts in Pakistan, for example, over the last week to portray the hijacking as a ``plot'' by Indian intelligence agencies to ``defame'' Pakistan.
The international reaction to India's allegations on Pakistan's involvement would be similar, if New Delhi does not lay out its case in public as well as in formal communications with other interested Governments.
Substantiating the claim
It is unlikely that any Government in the world would fall for the claims of the Taliban and the military regime in Islamabad that the hijackers and the terrorists have disappeared into thin air along the Pak-Afghan border. Nevertheless, India appears determined to fully reconstruct this ugly incident of terrorism, and put out all the relevant information to show the nature of the relationship between the hijackers and their controllers in Pakistan.
India's charges on the Pakistani aggression during the Kargil crisis gained considerable international credibility when the Government released the tapes of conversations between Gen. Pervez Musharraf, then Army chief, who was travelling in China, and his deputy, at Rawalpindi in late May 1999.
It would be surprising if India has not managed to intercept the communication between the hijackers and the ``third force'' that Mr. Singh referred to on Saturday. Some key interested states like the U.S., too, would have tracked the crisis very closely.
The Clinton administration has already documented the basic linkages of the notorious Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM), whose leader Maulana Masood Azhar the hijackers have now got, with Pakistan and Afghanistan. While Pakistan claims that it only provides ``moral and diplomatic support'' for the militant groups like the HUM, the U.S. has asserted that Pakistan provides them ``material support''.
In a testimony to the U.S. Senate in November, Ambassador Michael A. Sheehan summed up the facts on Pakistan's support to terrorist groups, in particular the HUM.
``Within the territory of Pakistan,'' Mr. Sheehan said, ``there are numerous Kashmiri separatist groups and sectarian groups involved in terrorism which use Pakistan as a base. Pakistan has frequently acknowledged what it calls `moral and diplomatic support' for militants in Kashmir who employ violence and terrorism against Indian interests.''
Mr. Sheehan went on to make the crucial point. ``We have continuing reports of Pakistani material support for some of these militants. One such group, the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, was involved in the still-unresolved July 1995 kidnapping of four Westerners...''
The U.S. has since designated the HUM as a terrorist organisation. Mr. Sheehan added that ``the HUM cooperates with (Osama) bin Laden and receives his assistance in maintaining training facilities in Afghanistan''.
The background of the hijackers and their links to the masterminds of terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan are well understood. India now needs to come up with specific details on the hijacking that can establish the relationship beyond doubt.
