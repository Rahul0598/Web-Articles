MUMBAI, JAN. 3. All motorised vehicles for hire operating in this city have kept off the roads for a week starting from Sunday midnight protesting against the Transport Commissioner's attempt to implement a High Court order seeking better control of polluting vehicles.
Consumer activists, however, point out that courts can initiate contempt proceedings against the striking taxi, rickshaw and truck operators for objecting to the judicial ruling.
The Maharashtra Transport Minister, Mr. Gangadhar Gade, said, ``it will be examined whether it was contempt of court.'' If the strikers have a grievance with the judicial directives calling for stringent checks, ``then they should move the Supreme Court.''
He emphasised that the Government was for talks with the strikers as ``we do not want people to suffer.''
Drivers of as many as 55,000 taxies, a similar number of autorickshaws, several thousand light commercial vehicles and trucks as well as chartered buses that take children to school stopped plying against the ruling.
Their argument was that if the vehicles were polluting the city's congested environment, it was due to fuel adulteration, especially of expensive petrol and not poor maintenance or age of the vehicles. The fault, they have told the Government here, lies elsewhere and there was no point in ``harassing'' them.
