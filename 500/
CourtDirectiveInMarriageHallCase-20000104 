CHENNAI, JAN. 3. A metropolitan magistrate in Chennai has directed film star Mr. Rajnikant and three others to appear before the court on February 2, in connection with a criminal complaint against the actor pertaining to the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam at Kodambakkam.
Taking on file the complaint from Mr. M. K. Manoharan, who claimed to hold patta for the land comprising the Kalyana Mandapam, the XI Metroplitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Mr. V. Arumugam said there was a prima facie case against Mr. Rajnikant and others.
Mr. Manoharan's case was that he was the patta-holder for a property measuring about 9.5 acres in Puliyur, Kodambakkam. But it was taken away by force by the four - Mr. Rajinkant, Mr. Muraliprasad Rao, Mr. Asathulla Basha and Mr. Krishna Rao. In 1989, the four started constructing a marriage hall (now Raghavendra mandapam) to which he objected. Following a civil case, he was declared as the patta holder in 1998. But in 1990, Mr. Manoharan alleged, he was taken away by the defendants and was forced to sign some blank papers. These were used as documents against him.The marriage hall was constructed. He had lodged a complaint to the police and the Commissioner of Police. As there was no action, he had preferred the present petition seeking action against the defendants.
