COLOMBO, JAN. 1. Public display of fireworks celebrating the new millennium in Colombo and the booming artillery shells in the northern Jaffna Peninsula signalled Sri Lanka's march into the year 2000.
As revelry overtook the residents of Colombo in continued fighting in northern Sri Lanka, at least 63 LTTE militants were reported killed in clashes with the security forces in the past two days.
The largest casualties were reported from the Jaffna Peninsula where 30 militants were killed at Vathirayan on Thursday. Another 24 militants, ``including two sub-leaders'' were reported killed in fighting yesterday.
The Defence Ministry said it had regained Iyakachchi in the Jaffna Peninsula and that it was ``consolidating the newly- captured areas. While nine more militants were reported killed in other confrontations, eight Government troopers were reported killed in fighting. An attempt by the Sea Tigers was also ``engaged effectively'' by deploying MI 24 helicopter gunships.
Intensified fighting had been going on in the northern Peninsula with the Tigers launching an attack on the crucial Elephant Pass Army complex since December 11.
Military observers said it would be ``difficult'' for the LTTE to gain control over Elephant Pass.
The Tigers lost control over Jaffna four years ago and the Elephant Pass offensive was seen as an attempt by the LTTE to regain control over Jaffna.
