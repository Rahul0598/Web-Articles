HYDERABAD, JAN. 2. The Union Minister of State for Urban Development, Mr. B. Dattatreya, has demanded publication by the State Government a `White Paper' on the development of Telangana. He also asked the Government to revive the three regional development boards.
Inaugurating a symposium on ``Development of Telangana in the new millennium'', organised by the People's Forum for Telangana development``, here on Sunday, Mr. Dattatreya pointed out that it was the Government's duty to project the correct picture, justifying his demand for the white paper. He suggested that the Vision 2020 Document be divided into three parts for each region of the State.
Mr. Dattatreya also mooted district-wise allocation of funds for development works, which alone would ensure proper progress. He appealed to the State Government to ensure that there was no injustice to Telangana at least in the new millennium, as was the case during the last 40 years.
To get over the problem of irrigation, one of the main issues dogging the region, the Minister felt that small projects exploiting the 9,000 tanks should be the thrust of the future. He assured the Forum to secure more Central funds for these projects.
Referring to the pending irrigation projects, Mr. Dattatreya favoured a time-bound action programme spread over five to ten years. He said the four Union Ministers from the State would not stand any injustice and compromise on overcoming backwardness in Telangana.
