SYDNEY, JAN. 4. Indian `all-rounder' Ajit Agarkar, who holds the World record for fastest 50 wickets in one-day cricket, today equalled another - albeit a dubious one - when he notched up his fifth successive duck in Tests.
Agarkar, dismissed first ball in a row in the last four innings, fell to the second ball he faced in the third Test against Australia, which India lost by an innings and 141 runs today, to tie with Australian Bob Holland, who achieved the dubious mark in 1985.
Agarkar, who like Holland has two pairs in sequence, also has the `distinction' of being the only batsman in the world to be dismissed for four successive first ball ducks. The list of maximum consecutive ducks has 16 batsmen who were dismissed for zero four times in a row including two from India - Pankaj Roy (1952) and Ramakant Desai (1959).
