Sun sign Virgo (Aug. 22 to Sept. 22)
Promotion at hand for those in the uniformed services. Employed women and stage and cine artists see fine opportunities. Delays may affect payments due to you and expenses may sky-rocket. Avoid speculation. Go carefully in romance. Avoid new ventures. You may find it difficult to get an associate's or a sibling's support. Some of you may move residence. Students, politicians, sportspersons and professionals must stay alert.
Moon in KANYA (Stars - the last three quarters of Uttaraphalguni, Hashta and the first two quarters of Chitta)
Politicians may not make headway. Bright sunshine for professionals and students. A pending legal issue issettled to your advantage. Do not be too frank with others. No useful gains from speculation and pursuing romance. Your spouse and a wardsmay have a health difficulty. Domestic help and office subordinates should not be shown any leniency.
