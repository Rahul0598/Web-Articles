JALANDHAR, JAN. 4. The Punjab Chief Minister, Mr. Parkash Singh Badal, today inaugurated a Rs. 5-crore bridge over Nasrala Choe rivulet which has been constructed by the public through `kar sewa' (voluntary service) led by a local sant.
The 1008-ft long and 23-ft wide bridge at Manko Jabbar village, 45 km from here, has 13 spans and is built as an example of voluntary public action for development.
Constructed in one year through kar sewa, it would shorten the Hoshiarpur-Phagwara distance by 10 km and would benefit about 20 villages in the vicinity.
