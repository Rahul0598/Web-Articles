FROM KARGIL to vedic chants, Y2K and post-death experience, information is available, not at the click of a mouse, but through the old-fashioned method of flipping pages.
And in the coming new year, where revolutions are going to be led by knowledge seekers, perhaps the ``India Encyclopedic Millennium Resource,'' released recently in the city, will be a guide. Besides offering a glimpse of `India to Indians', the resource book-cum-diary also attempts to encapsulate lofty Indian philosophical thought. Well, actually, the twin diaries and a colourful wall planner are supposed to come free with the reference book.
The diary, which can be used over a period of two years - 2000, 2001 - has been put together by Mr. Hanna Myer, director, Mermaid Centre and editor-in-chief, ``India 2001,'' a multi-volume Indian encyclopaedia that is an ongoing project. The facts and figures that have been splashed throughout the resource book are out of the two-volume encyclopaedia that was compiled by Mermaid Centre.
Capsules of various Indian concepts have been spread out in colour, with some colour pages estimated to cost as much Rs. 4 lakhs each to produce, according to Mr. Myer. There is also a vision that the book dreams up for the nation, with ``realistic projections'' culled from available data.
The ambitious Rs. 595 publication has been brought out with the assistance of 450 editors including Dr. M. S. Swaminathan, Dr. Karan Singh, Dr. Raja Ramanna and Mr. Khushwant Singh. A look at the book indicates that better production values would enhance the objectives of the publication, particularly in the realm of visuals.
The resource book has been released in Delhi and Bangalore and will be available at select bookstores in the city.
