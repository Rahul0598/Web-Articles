CHENNAI, JAN. 4. The case pertaining to `Jeeva Transport Corporation' (JTC) scam during the previous AIADMK rule today took a serious turn with the counsel for the accused alleging that the CB CID was ``threatening'' prosecution witnesses, who turned hostile.
The defence counsel also met the Special Judge-I, Mr. S. Sambandham, in whose court the trial was being conducted, in his chamber, and informed him of the matter.
After the witnesses in the case were examined and the Judge had retired to his chamber in the evening, advocates for the accused alleged that a prosecution witness, Mr. Viswanathan of Karur, who was treated as hostile today, was initially taken to the prosecutor's room, located by the side of the court hall, and later to the investigating agency's room in the second floor. ``Why should the witness be unnecessarily taken away by police?'', they wanted to know. They said this was not the first instance of the investigating agency intimidating witnesses who turned hostile; on an earlier occasion, another witness was ``taken to task'' by police.
The lawyers went to the Judge's chamber and represented the matter to him. The Judge then called for the Special Public Prosecutor, the Deputy Superintendent of Police concerned, former Transport Minister, Mr. K. A. Sengottaiyan, and former Managing Director of JTC, Mr. Veerappan, accused in the case, and after listening both sides asked them to ensure that they did not give room for unpleasantness within the court and outside in future.
During chief examination, Mr. Viswanathan said his and three other units had supplied 71 bus body kits to JTC and he paid a total of Rs. 7.10 lakhs as commission to Mr. `Gobi' Natarajan, another accused in the case, and Rs. 3.55 lakhs to former JTC MDs, Paramasivam (since deceased) and Mr. Veerappan, for procuring the orders. The witness said he had supplied bus body spares to the corporation and paid Rs. 20,000 as commission to Mr. Natarajan for getting orders for the supply.
The witness said in September 1994 Paramasivam rang him up and told him that the former Transport Minister was coming to Erode and would stay in the Guest House there and that he (Viswanathan) should meet him. Accordingly, he went there and he was introduced to the Minister by Mr. Paramasivam. After the meeting, he came away. Mr. Viswanathan said he had not given anything to the former Minister. As this statement was contrary to what he had said in his statements to police and the Magistrate, he was allowed to be treated as hostile at the request of the prosecution.
During cross examination by prosecution, the witness said he did not remember as to whether he told the Magistrate and the police that he gave Rs. 20,000 to the former Minister when he met him at Erode. He denied having given any amount to Mr. Sengottaiyan. He also did not know whether he attended the wedding reception of Mr. Sengottaiyan's son.
Meanwhile, Mr. Selvaraj, an accused in the `disproportionate wealth case' against the former MLA, Ms. G. Malliga, complained of dizziness when trial was on in the court today. He was later taken to a hospital.
