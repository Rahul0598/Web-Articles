CALCUTTA, JAN. 2. The Railway Minister, Ms. Mamata Banerjee, today said the Prime Minister, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, had no alternative but to release three militants to secure the release of the 155 hijacked passengers.
``The (Union) Government had no choice. The militants were carrying explosives and threatening to blow up the aircraft. Mr. Vajpayee had no alternative,'' Ms. Banerjee told presspersons here, when asked whether the Centre had taken the right step in exchanging the militants for the hostages.
The Trinamul Congress chief, however, said that the Centre had delayed in taking the decision. ``The hijackers must be punished,'' she said.
Ms. Banerjee refused to comment when asked about the reported difference between the Union Home Minister, Mr. L. K. Advani, and the Prime Minister over the means to secure the release of the hostages.
