CAPE TOWN, JAN. 2. Perhaps the most interesting point made by the South African President, Mr. Thabo Mbeki in his year-end address to the nation was his reference to the ``unresolved matter of Western Sahara.''
Describing the new century as ``Africa's century of hope,'' Mr. Mbeki, in his nationwide broadcast over radio and T.V., said South Africans could take pride in the fact that the 20th century saw an end to the system of colonialism and white minority rule in the continent ``except for the unresolved matter of Western Sahara.''
Mr. Mbeki's speech was notable as much for the call for celebration of the victory over colonialism and racism as for its critical self-introspection on the failures of many post- colonial nation-States in Africa to set their houses in order. A crucial passage in the speech sums it up: ``As Africans, we have seen too many military coups, too many wars, too many people massacred, maimed, displaced and turned into refugees. We have watched as millions of our people have sunk deeper and deeper into poverty and fallen victim to many diseases, including AIDS. We have had to live with corruption. We have seen our continent getting marginalised. As we enter the new century and millennium, we must, as Africans, say, `Enough is enough.'''
The reference to Western Sahara has to be viewed in the context of the self-critical analysis of the larger political scenario on the continent. While Western Sahara is not the ``only unresolved matter'' on the continent, the reference places Western Sahara among the issues inherited and in some ways even related to the ``system of colonialism.'' Indeed, the reference may well mark a shift in South Africa's policy on this tricky issue, facilitated by the apparent commitment to a more democratic governance by the new Moroccan monarch, King Mohammed VI. The new king is known to be keen on securing a settlement to the Western Sahara issue, a pre-requisite for a rapprochment with Algeria and the eventual return of Morocco to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
When Morocco attained independence in March 1956, the then Spanish protectorate of Western Sahara, itself a territory of contention between Morocco and Mauritania, did not automatically revert to either of these countries. While the continued Spanish occupation of the territory was condemned in several U.N. General Assembly resolutions, Western Sahara's own political future got entangled with the territorial ambitions of its neighbours in the north and the south. A tripartite agreement involving Spain, Morocco and Mauritania in November 1975 effectively partitioned the territory between Morocco and Mauritania - leading to the setting of an in exile Government of the Saharawi Republic in Algeria by Polisario, the liberation movement founded in 1973 which has been fighting for self- determination. The conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Polisario by Mauritania and the withdrawal of Mauritania from its part of Western Sahara led to Morocco occupying the whole territory in 1979.
Morocco insists that Western Sahara is part of its territory though it is committed to a U.N. supervised referendum to determine the political future of Western Sahara. Such a referendum is provided in the ceasefire agreement of September 1991 between Morocco and Polisario, after nearly 15 years of fighting. However, disputes between Morocco and Polisario on who is qualified to vote in the envisaged referendum have hindered its holding. Central to the dispute is the settlement of many Moroccans in the territory since the last census held under Spanish supervision in 1974. Polisario insists that these post- 1974 settlers should not be allowed to vote.
Indeed, despite its commitment to a referendum, Morocco has not returned to the OAU from which it walked out following the admission of a Western Saharan delegation to take part in the OAU summit at Addis Ababa in November 1984. Given this background, any initiative to tackle the ``unresolved matter of Western Sahara'' can only be taken with the concurrence of Morocco, indeed a positive change in its stand.
Though the African National Congress (ANC) as a liberation movement supported Polisario and indeed recognised the Saharawi Republic, democratic South Africa as a nation-State has been rather more cautious on the issue. A joint statement issued in July 1988 by the late Oliver Tambo, then President of the ANC (with whom Mr. Mbeki worked closely during his years of exile), and Mr. Mohamed Abdel Aziz, secretary-general of the Polisario and President of the Saharawi Republic, ``paid warm tributes to the freedom fighters of South Africa and the Saharawi Republic for their valiant and determined fight against the racist regime of South Africa and the expansionist Moroccans.'' The two leaders specifically called upon the international community ``to force Morocco to respect and implement the decisions of the OAU, the UN and the Non-aligned Movement on Western Sahara''.
These perceptions, however, failed to find a place in the actual policy of the new democratic Government in South Africa. Though Mr. Mandela personally appeared to be sympathetic to the Polisario, he was also close to King Hassan II, making both an official and ``private'' visit to Morocco during his term of office.
